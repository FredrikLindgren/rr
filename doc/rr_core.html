Summary</big><br>
<br>
The
core components of the Rogue Rebalancing mod strive&nbsp;to bring
the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) of Baldur's
Gate 2&nbsp;closer to their Pen and Paper <acronym title="Second Edition">2E</acronym>&nbsp;<acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
counterparts. In so far, these components can restore proper
dual-wielding skills to Bards and
Thieves, revise the Bard and Thief kits and their respective
high level ability tables, restore the proper <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> spell progression
table for Bards, add more items useful for Rogues to the game and
slightly revise the thievery aspect of the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Proper_dual-wielding_implementation_for"></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proper
dual-wielding implementation for Thieves and Bards</span></span></big><br>
<br>
According
the the second edition <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
Player's Handbook the "Two Weapon
Fighting" style should be fully available to Rogues. While it seems
that Baldur's Gate 2 uses a modified proficiency system from the
"Combat and Tactics" supplement, the game still fails to
properly grant Rogues this benefit. This issue was resolved by allowing
all Rogues (Thieves, Bards and their Kits and Multi-classes) to assign
up to three points into "Two Weapon Fighting" instead of just one. The
reasoning for this change is described below: <br>
<br>
A
quote from the <acronym title="Second Edition">2E</acronym>
<acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
"Player's Handbook":<br>
<br>
<cite>"Attacking
with Two Weapons; A tricky fighting style available only to warriors
and rogues is that of fighting with two weapons simultaneously. The
character chooses not to use a shield in favor of another weapon,
granting him a greater number of attacks, with a penalty to his attack
rolls (rangers are exempt from the attack roll penalty)."</cite><br>
<br>
A
quote from the <acronym title="Second Edition">2E</acronym>
<acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
"Combat and Tactics" supplement:<br>
<br>
<cite>"Two
Weapon; Not to be confused with the two-handed weapon style,two weapon
style uses a weapon in each of the character's hands. The advantage of
this is clear: the character either has more attack power or can use
the secondary weapon defensively to block incoming blows. Another
benefit lies in the fact that even if the character loses a weapon,
he's still armed. The character can use any one-handed weapon in his
primary hand, but his secondary weapon must be a size smaller than his
primary weapon. Knives and daggers can always be used, regardless of
the primary weapon's size. The character suffers a -2 penalty to
attacks with the primary weapon, and a -4 to attacks with the secondary
weapon. This penalty is offset by the character's reaction adjustment
for high Dexterity. Important Note: While the character receives his
normal number of attacks for class, level, and specialization with his
primary weapon, he only receives one additional attack with his
secondary weapon. Warriors and Rogues know two weapon fighting style."</cite><br>

This
component will alter the
Assassin,&nbsp;Swashbuckler and the Bounty Hunter thief kits so
that they&nbsp;match their&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>&nbsp;counterparts
more closely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="Assassin_kit_changes"></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assassin</span><br>
<br>Through this revision, Assassins can no longer be good aligned, their bonus to hit and damage has been
replaced with Poison Expertise, the Poison
Weapon ability has been altered in order to properly scale with levels
and a new Death Attack ability has been added at higher levels. The
updated kit description reads as follows:<br><br>ASSASSIN:
This is a killer specialized in discreet and efficient murder, relying
on anonymity and surprise to perform his task. Training in anatomy,
stealth and poison use allows an Assassin to carry out missions of
death with terrifying precision. A clever Assassin might never be seen
by his victim.<br><br>Advantages:<br>-&nbsp; May use Poison Weapon once per day at 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter<br>-&nbsp; Acquires Poison Expertise at 8th level. This ability improves further every 8 levels thereafter<br>-&nbsp; May use Death Attack once per day at 16th level and every 8 levels thereafter<br>-&nbsp; Backstab reaches x7 instead of x5<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>-&nbsp; Only 15% per level to distribute on abilities<br>-&nbsp; Must be of evil or neutral alignment<br><br>Poison Weapon:<br>Due
to the requirements of his profession, an Assassin becomes adapt at
coating his weapons in poison early during his career.&nbsp;Any weapon
prepared in this manner
will deal an extra 1d3 points of poison damage upon contact.
Furthermore, unless a saving throw vs. poison is made, the poison will
be injected into the bloodstream of the victim dealing one additional
point of damage per each level of the Assassin (up to a maximum of 20).
The poison coating evaporates after 5 rounds. Constructs, Elementals,
Slimes and Undead creatures cannot be poisoned.<br><br>Poison Expertise<br>Through
training and experience, an Assassin gradually learns to utilize poison
more effectively. Furthermore, due to the constant exposure to poison
an Assassin slowly becomes desensitized towards it. Each time this
ability is acquired, the Assassin gains a permanent +1 bonus to his
saving throws vs. poison. At the same time, the saving throw difficulty
class of his Poison Weapon ability improves by 1.<br><br>Death Attack:<br>By
thoroughly studying the weak spots of his victim, an Assassin can focus
all of his cunning and prowess into a single, deadly strike. The next
attack he makes automatically becomes a critical hit and his victim
must make a saving throw vs. death or die instantly. As the Assassin
gains more experience, the lethality of the Death Attack increases. The
victim saves with a -1 penalty at level 24, a -2 penalty at level 32
and a -3 penalty at level 40. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead
creatures cannot be slain by a Death Attack.<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="Swashbuckler_kit_changes"></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Swashbuckler</span><br>
<br>
The
Swashbuckler kit now uses the Fighter's <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>
advancement table (i.e. <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>
improves by one point at each level up) when wielding melee weapons, as
described in the "Complete Thief's
Handbook"
<acronym title="Second Edition">2E</acronym>
<acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
supplement. Note that this trait replaces the "+1 to hit per 5
levels" bonus which was present in the unmodded game. Furthermore,
Swashbucklers no longer receive
an
innate damage bonus, cannot&nbsp;dual-class to Fighters (they can
still
dual-class to Mages or Clerics though) and can no longer benefit from
an increase to the backstab multiplier provided by&nbsp;items
(such as the revised Short Sword of Backstabbing). The updated kit description reads as follows:<br><br>SWASHBUCKLER: This rogue is part acrobat, part swordsman and part wit: the epitome of charm and grace.<br><br>Advantages:<br>-&nbsp; Gains +1 bonus to armor class for every 5 levels<br>-&nbsp; Uses the Fighter's THAC0 progression table while wielding melee weapons<br>-&nbsp; Can specialize in any melee weapon that a thief can use<br>-&nbsp; Can acquire the Whirlwind ability at higher levels<br>-&nbsp; Can acquire the Insightful Strike ability at higher levels<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>-&nbsp; Cannot backstab<br>-&nbsp; Cannot dual-class to a Fighter<br>-&nbsp; Cannot acquire the Assassination ability<br>-&nbsp; Cannot acquire the Crippling Strike ability<br>
<br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="Bounty_Hunter_kit_changes"></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bounty
Hunter</span><br>
<br>
Through this revision, the Bounty Hunter relies on mechanical
devices and alchemical substances for incapacitating
his prey, rather than imbuing his snares with magical effects as was
the case in the unmodded game. In summary, the
Bounty Hunter's special snares have been replaced with Alchemical
Traps, he can now coat his weapons in Paralytic Toxin and his&nbsp;Alchemical Expertise improves as he gains more experience.
Finally,&nbsp;a Bounty Hunter can now also choose the Tracking&nbsp;<acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> at higher levels. The updated kit description reads as follows:<br>
<br>BOUNTY HUNTER:<br>This is a hunter of men, skilled in tracking and
capturing quarry, whether for lawful authorities or underworld masters.
Due to the frequent need to bring his prey back alive, a Bounty Hunter
often relies on alchemical substances that can incapacitate or weaken
his victims. A Bounty Hunter's trap making abilities are also well
beyond those of the average thief.<br><br>Advantages:<br>-&nbsp; Gains a +15% bonus to the Set Traps skill at 1st level<br>-&nbsp; May use Paralytic Toxin once per day at 1st level and every 10 levels thereafter<br>-&nbsp; Can lay Alchemical Traps in addition to regular snares<br>-&nbsp; Acquires Alchemical Expertise at 10th level. This ability further improves every 10 levels thereafter<br>-&nbsp; Can acquire the Tracking ability at higher levels<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>-&nbsp; Gets only 20% to distribute between thief abilities at each level<br><br>Paralytic Toxin:<br>The
Bounty Hunter's intricate understanding of alchemy and herbalism allows
him to create a substance that causes severe loss of muscle function
when injected into the bloodstream. This paralytic toxin is a
transparent, odorless liquid which can be easily applied to weapons
without fear of detection. A hit from any weapon coated in this
substance causes the target to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or
become paralyzed for one round per every ten levels of the Bounty
Hunter. However, the toxin evaporates quickly when exposed to air
making the coating last only a single round. Constructs, Elementals,
Slimes and Undead creatures are unaffected by the Paralytic Toxin.<br><br>Alchemical Traps:<br>Combining
his superior trap setting skills with alchemical knowledge, a Bounty
Hunter can create traps that are primarily designed for incapacitating
his opponents, rather than killing them outright. The effects of the
traps vary according to the Bounty Hunter's level, but always last for
five rounds and can be negated by a successful saving throw vs. breath:<br><br>1st:&nbsp; trap deals 2d4 points of subdual damage and dazzles the target<br>6th:&nbsp; trap deals 4d4 points of subdual damage and slows the target<br>11th: trap deals 6d4 points of subdual damage and entangles the target<br>16th: trap deals 8d4 points of subdual damage and blinds the target<br>21st: trap deals 10d4 points of subdual damage and renders the target unconscious<br><br>Note:
subdual damage is non-lethal and will render the target unconscious if
its hit points drop below 0 instead of killing it. Constructs,
Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures are immune to subdual damage.<br><br>Alchemical Expertise<br>Through
training and experience, a Bounty Hunter gradually learns to utilize
alchemical substances more effectively. Each time this ability is
acquired, the saving throw difficulty class of the Bounty Hunter's
Paralytic Toxin and Alchemical Traps improves by 1.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: The setting range of the Alchemical
Traps has been reduced to normal (i.e. they cannot be "thrown" as in
the unmodded game). Furthermore,&nbsp;the traps
no
longer have the spell-like Maze/Otiluke's Resilient
Sphere&nbsp;effects and the
physical damage component (which was missing from level 16 onward) has
been restored. Their new secondary effects are alchemical
(rather than magical) in nature&nbsp; and therefore completely ignore any
magic resistance of
their targets.&nbsp;However, specific creatures may be innately immune to
certain effects. For example, Constructs, Slimes, Elementals and Undead
creatures
cannot be&nbsp;dazzled or rendered unconscious, flying
and&nbsp;incorporeal creatures like Wyverns, Beholders, Shadows,
Mists,
Air and Fire Elementals cannot be slowed by the grease effect, while
exceptionally large
creatures (Dragons, Giants, Iron Golems) and incorporeal creatures
(Shadows, Mists, Air and Fire Elementals) cannot be entangled. It
should
also be noted
that slowed, entangled and blinded creatures temporarily lose
any dexterity bonus to their armor class since they cannot dodge
attacks effectively while they are incapacitated.</span><br><br>

<big style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a name="Thief_High_Level_Ability_revisions"></a>Thief
High Level Ability revisions</big><br>
<br>
<br>
This component will revise the Thief High Level Ability table
by&nbsp;replacing all magic-based <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLAs</acronym>&nbsp;with
new abilities which are more fitting for the Thief class. Furthermore,
some of the non-magical Thief&nbsp;<acronym title="High Level Ability">HLAs</acronym>&nbsp;will
be modified in order to match their&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> counterparts more
closely. In effect,&nbsp;Scribe
Scrolls&nbsp;<acronym title="High Level Ability"></acronym>will
be replaced with Crippling Strike,&nbsp;Time Trap will be replaced
with Acid Trap, Greater Evasion&nbsp;will be replaced
with Danger Sense while Evasion and Alchemy now work more akin to their
<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
counterparts.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Crippling_Strike"></a>Crippling Strike</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(replaces Scribe Scrolls)</span><br>
<br>
An experienced Thief can use the knowledge of his opponent's weak
spots to gain an advantage in combat. During the round when this
ability is activated, every attack of the Thief deals maximum damage
and may weaken his target. On each successful hit the victim must make
a saving throw vs. death (with a -4 penalty) or have its strength score
lowered to 10 for the next five rounds. Note: Constructs, Elementals,
Slimes and Undead creatures are completely unaffected by this ability.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">(</span><span style="font-style: italic;">replaces Scribe Scrolls, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Swashbuckler only)</span><br>
<br>
An experienced Swashbuckler can use the knowledge of his opponent's
weak spots to gain an advantage in combat. During the round when this
ability is activated, the Swashbuckler receives a +5 bonus to his
critical hit rolls and deals maximum damage with each attack.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Danger_Sense"></a>Danger
Sense</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(</span><span style="font-style: italic;">replaces Greater Evasion</span><span style="font-style: italic;">)</span><br>
<br>
By studying his surroundings intently, an experienced Thief can
predict the actions of his opponents through cunning insight and
extraordinary perception. Any potentially hostile actions are perceived
in advance, giving the Thief enough time to react appropriately. This
uncanny sense for impending danger almost borders on precognition and
grants the Thief a +5 bonus to his armor class and all saving throws
for 5 rounds after this ability is activated. Furthermore, as the Thief
cannot be surprised nor caught off guard while using this ability, he
is not susceptible to backstab attacks until the duration expires.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Evasion"></a>Evasion</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(revised ability)</span><br>
<br>
Thieves of exceptional skill can avoid damage from energy
discharges such as breath weapons, fireball spells and the like through
a combination of superior reflexes and extraordinary agility. Through
nearly superhuman effort, a Thief can position himself out of harm's
way mere seconds before an energy discharge reaches him. After
activating this ability the Thief can evade the effects of the
following spells: Burning Hands, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Call
Lightning, Flame Strike, Cone of Cold, Sunfire, Chain Lightning,
Delayed Blast Fireball and all forms of Dragon's Breath. The Evasion
ability expires after five rounds.<br>
<br>
Requires: Danger Sense<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Spike_Trap"></a>Spike Trap</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(revised ability)</span><br>
<br>This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful spring-loaded spike
trap that deals 20D6 points of piercing damage to the unsuspecting
creature that sets it off.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">
Note: the Spike Trap now deals piercing damage. For reference, in the
original game its damage type was flagged as magical (i.e. like Magic
Missile) which didn't make much sense for a non-magical ability</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Acid_Trap"></a>Acid
Trap</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(replaces
Time Trap)</span><br>
<br>
This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful trap that splashes
nearby opponents with a highly vitriolic alchemical mixture which deals
10d6 points of acid damage. Once the acid engulfs a target it becomes
difficult to remove. Afflicted opponents must make a saving throw vs.
breath or take an additional 2d6 points of acid damage during each of
the following three rounds. Creatures who are particularly vulnerable
to acid damage (such as Trolls) do not get a saving throw.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">
Note: the Acid Trap is alchemical </span><span style="font-style: italic;">(rather than magical) </span><span style="font-style: italic;">in nature and is therefore not subject to the target's magic resistance.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Exploding_Trap"></a>Exploding Trap</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(revised ability)</span><br>
<br>By mixing unstable alchemical compounds together, a rogue can set a
powerful trap which unleashes a violent explosion when triggered. The
force of the blast deals 15d6 points of fire damage to all nearby
opponents, pushing them back and knocking them off their feet. Enemies
may attempt to save vs. breath in order to reduce the damage by half
and avoid being pushed away and knocked down. Exceptionally large or
heavy creatures (Dragons, Giants, Stone and Iron Golems) may take
damage but are unaffected by the secondary effects of the blast.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">
Note: the Exploding Trap is alchemical </span><span style="font-style: italic;">(rather than magical) </span><span style="font-style: italic;">in nature and is therefore not subject to the target's magic resistance.</span><br>

<br>
With cleverness innate to the class, an experienced thief has seen
enough potions in his or her adventuring career to simulate the
creation of one. However, the costs for any raw materials that are used
in the process must be paid. This ability allows a thief to brew one of
the potions from the following list:<br>
<br>
1) Potion of Master Thievery<br>
2) Potion of Perception<br>
3) Potion of Invisibility<br>
4) Potion of Defense<br>
5) Potion of Superior Healing<br>
6) Elixir of Health<br>
7) Oil of Speed<br>
8) Oil of Fiery Burning<br>
9) Potion of Frost Giant Strength, only usable by thieves or bards<br>
<br><span style="font-style: italic;">
Note: brewing potions is a delicate task which can only be undertaken
in safe (non-hostile) areas.&nbsp;Due to his advanced alchemical
knowledge, a Bounty Hunter can make three times as many potions as a
regular rogue in one setting.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>

This
component will modify all
Bard kits so that they&nbsp;match their&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>&nbsp;counterparts
more closely, as
described in the <acronym title="Second Edition">2E&nbsp;</acronym>
<acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
"Complete
Bard's
Handbook" supplement. The kits now get additional benefits but also
receive new disadvantages. The default Bard song has also been
altered (it
was largely defunct in the unmodded game) and is now
based on the <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
version of this ability.&nbsp;Furthermore, the hearing range of all
battlesongs&nbsp;has been standardized
and&nbsp;now extends slightly above the in-game visual range of the
performing Bard.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="Generic_Bard_changes"></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">True Bard</span><br>
<br>
The
Bard's song has been altered as it was almost completely non-functional
in the original game. The revised Bard song is based on the Pen and
Paper version of this ability. The updated kit description reads as follows:<br><br>BARD:
The bard is also a rogue, but he is very different from the thief. His
strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits
he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a
walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little
bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all- trades
but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and
songs are welcome almost everywhere and are often inspirational to the
listeners. A bard can rally his allies by singing heroic songs or
weaving inspiring tales about how his companions will overcome their
foes and win the day. The effect of the bard's song varies according to
his level:<br><br>1st:&nbsp;&nbsp; +1 to hit and all saving throws, song raises morale<br>9th:&nbsp;&nbsp; +2 to hit and all saving throws, song removes fear<br>18th:&nbsp; +3 to hit and all saving throws, song protects from fear<br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="Blade_kit_changes"></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blade</span><br>
<br>
Blades
now automatically start with maximum proficiency (3 points) in Two
Weapon Fighting style as
described in the <acronym title="Second Edition">2E&nbsp;</acronym>
<acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
"Complete
Bard's
Handbook" supplement. They also get a new special ability called
"Weapons Display" once for every 10 experience levels (starting with
one use at level 1). However, Blades no longer gain access to the
"Enhanced Bard Song"&nbsp;<acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym>.
They can now pick the
Whirlwind <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym>
instead. The updated kit description reads as follows:<br>
<br>BLADE: The Blade is an expert fighter and adventurer whose bardic
acting abilities make him appear more intimidating and fearsome. If
there is a showy way to wield or perform with a weapon, a Blade knows
how to do it better than anyone. Blades often perform amazing displays
of skill and control as they whirl various weapons about their bodies
with deadly precision. The weapons of a Blade are always kept in
perfect condition and highly polished for maximum effect during a
battle or a performance. Blades regularly train and perform with
weapons in both hands eventually developing complete ambidexterity.<br><br>Advantages:<br>-&nbsp; May use the Offensive Spin and Defensive Spin abilities once per day per 4 levels<br>-&nbsp; May use the Weapons Display ability once per day per 10 levels<br>-&nbsp; Obtains maximum proficiency in two weapon fighting style at first level<br>-&nbsp; Can acquire the Whirlwind ability at higher levels<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>-&nbsp; Only has one-half normal Lore value<br>-&nbsp; Only has one-half Pick Pockets percentage<br>-&nbsp; Battlesong does not improve with levels<br>-&nbsp; Cannot acquire the Enhanced Battlesong ability<br>-&nbsp; Cannot acquire the Lingering Song ability<br><br>Offensive Spin: <br>This
ability lasts for 24 seconds granting the Blade +2 bonus to hit and
damage and an extra attack. All of the Blade's attacks do maximum
damage for the duration.<br><br>Defensive Spin: <br>This ability lasts
for 24 seconds and grants the Blade a +1 bonus to Armor Class per each
level of experience, up to a maximum of 10. The Blade cannot move away
from the initial spot while performing a Defensive Spin.<br><br>Weapons Display:<br>By
whirling a melee weapon about his body a Blade can affect the morale
and courage of others. Such a display of skill, precision, and deadly
grace lowers opponents' morale (enemies must save vs. spell to avoid
morale failure) and simultaneously inspires allies, granting a +1 bonus
to their attack rolls. The display must occur for a full round without
interruption. During this time, any successful attack upon the Blade or
failed saving throw by the Blade disrupts the display. Weapons Display
is an extraordinary (non-magical) ability, therefore it completely
ignores any magic resistance of the subject creatures. Undead,
Constructs, Slimes, Animals and Demonic creatures are completely
unaffected by the Weapons Display. Furthermore, the ability cannot
affect creatures whose total Hit Dice exceed the Blade's current level
and creatures with more than 20 Hit Dice are completely unaffected. The
effectiveness and the duration of this ability improve as the Blade
gains more levels. The bonus granted to the attack rolls of allies and
the saving throw penalty for the enemies increase by one point per ten
experience levels of the Blade. The effects of Weapons Display last for
one round per each level of the Blade.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="Jester_kit_changes"></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jester</span><br>
<br>
Jesters&nbsp;now have to be partially chaotic aligned (instead of
partially neutral
aligned) and are limited to the Thieves' weapon proficiency selection.
The Jester's song has been slightly altered as well. Furthermore,
Jesters&nbsp;gain two new
innate traits: "Fool's Luck" and "Chaotic Mind", as
described in the <acronym title="Second Edition">2E&nbsp;</acronym>
<acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>
"Complete
Bard's
Handbook" supplement. The updated kit description reads as follows:<br>
<br>JESTER: This bard is well versed in the arts of ridicule and
hilarity and uses his abilities to distract, confuse and mesmerize his
enemies, cavorting madly during combat. Many sages believe that Jesters
live in a constant state of borderline insanity. It's known that they
crave for attention and feel at ease only when they are the focus of
events. All Jesters are chaotically aligned, since no mind attuned to
law and order could possibly sustain such an odd personality. Due to
their peculiar fighting style, Jesters tend to avoid large and unwieldy
weapons.<br><br>Advantages:<br>-&nbsp; Gains Jester's Song at first level. This ability further improves at 9th and 18th level<br>-&nbsp; Gains Fool's Luck and Chaotic Mind as passive traits at first level<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>-&nbsp; Can only become proficient with weapons that are usable by the Thief class<br>-&nbsp; Must be Chaotic aligned<br>-&nbsp; Battlesong doesn't help allies<br><br>Jester's Song:<br>A
Jester's Song doesn't help allies. Instead, it distracts every opponent
within hearing range. The effect of the song further improves as the
Jester gains more levels:<br><br>1st:&nbsp;&nbsp; Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (+4 save bonus)<br>9th:&nbsp;&nbsp; Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (+2 save bonus) and confused (+4 save bonus)<br>18th:&nbsp;
Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (no save bonus),
confused (+2 save bonus) and mesmerized (+4 save bonus)<br><br>Distracted
opponents have a 20% chance of spellcasting failure and suffer a 2
point penalty to their THAC0 and AC. Confused opponents either go
berserk and attack the nearest creature, stand still and babble
incoherently or wander about aimlessly. Mesmerized opponents have their
flow of thoughts disrupted to such an extent that they are unable to
take any rational actions while listening to Jester's song which
effectively incapacitates them. However, even in that state opponents
can still perceive danger on a subconscious level, so any hostile
action taken against them automatically breaks this effect. The
Jester's song has no effect on mindless creatures such as Constructs,
Skeletons, Zombies and Slimes.<br><br>Fool's Luck:<br>Jesters are
careless, foolish and given to whimsical decisions, yet they seem to
possess some uncanny ability which allows them to survive in almost any
situation. Fool's Luck adds a +1 bonus to the Jester's base Armor
Class, a +1 bonus to all of his saving throws and a +5% bonus to his
pickpocket skill checks.<br><br>Chaotic Mind:<br>Due to their unique mindset, Jesters are innately immune to the effects of spells, items and abilities that cause Confusion.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Skald_kit_changes"></a>Skald</span><br>
<br>
Skalds
now have a +1 penalty to the casting speed of all spells as an
additional
disadvantage. Their battlesong has been slightly revised as well. The updated kit description reads as follows:<br>
<br>SKALD: This Nordic bard is also a warrior of great strength, skill
and virtue. His songs are inspiring sagas of battle and valor, and the
Skald devotes his life to those pursuits. Skalds are honored and
respected as great warrior-poets who memorize the feats of each raid
and battle, setting them down in the form of poetry. Spells are nearly
unknown in the Skald's society and they are viewed with suspicion in
any event. Using magic is slightly more difficult for a Skald and
requires additional time and effort.<br><br>Advantages:<br>-&nbsp; Gains Skald's Song at first level. This ability further improves at 9th and 18th level<br>-&nbsp; Gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage with all weapons at first level<br><br>Disadvantages:<br>-&nbsp; Pick pockets ability one-quarter normal<br>-&nbsp; Suffers a 1 point penalty to spellcasting speed<br><br>Skald's Song:<br>By
chanting a war song, a Skald can inspire allies as they go forward into
combat. Chanting can elevate spirits, remove concerns about danger,
keep men's minds focused on combat and fill friendly forces with a
sense of being larger than life. The effects of the song further
improve as the Skald gains more levels:<br><br>1st:&nbsp; gives allies +2 to hit, +2 to damage, -2 to AC and immunity to Fear<br>9th:&nbsp; gives allies +3 to hit, +3 to damage, -3 to AC, immunity to Fear and Confusion<br>18th: gives allies +4 to hit, +4 to damage, -4 to AC, immunity to Fear, Stun and Confusion.<br>

<br>
An
experienced Bard eventually learns to influence the actions of his
opponents. By focusing his willpower a Bard can suggest a course of
activity which opponents feel strongly compelled to follow. The
suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity
sound reasonable. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out
and break the enchantment. If a common language is shared, the Bard can
generally force the subjects to perform as he desires, within the
limits of their abilities. If no common language is shared, the
character can communicate only by using basic commands, such as "Come
here," "Go there," "Fight," "Stand still" etc. Opponents can attempt a
saving throw vs. spells in order to avoid being controlled, but even if
they succeed, there is still a 25% chance that they will suffer a
mental breakdown from the amount of stress that their minds have
suffered. This will effectively cause them to enter a Berserk state (no

<br>Being non-magical in nature, this ability completely ignores any

softly humming a catchy tune, an experienced Bard can captivate and
enthrall any audience, even creatures that do not understand his
language. Opponents in the area of effect must successfully save vs.
paralyzation or give the Bard their undivided attention, totally
ignoring their surroundings and becoming fascinated for the following
five rounds. Fascinated creatures can take no actions for the duration
of the effect, however, they can still perceive danger on a
subconscious level so any hostile action taken against them
automatically breaks this state. In addition, even if opponents make
their saving throws and avoid the fascination effect, there is still a
25% chance that they will become confused for one round (no save) from
being too deeply immersed into the hypnotic pattern of the song.<br><br>Being

The
Bard magically amplifies the capabilities of a musical instrument in
order to fill his surroundings with high pitched stone-shattering sound
waves. Creatures in the nearby area take 15d6 points of sonic damage
and are also deafened for five rounds. Deafened creatures suffer a 50%
chance of spellcasting failure. A successful save vs. breath halves the
damage and negates the deafness.<br>

<br>
Once
a
Bard's musical talents have reached a significant level, his music can
stay with the listeners long after the last note has died away. After
the Bard stops playing, the effects of his or her song last an
additional 2 rounds.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a name="Magic_Flute"></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Magic Flute</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(revised ability)</span><br>
<br>
This ability creates an enchanted flute made of pure magical energy
which remains in existence for 8 hours. When played by a bard of
exceptional talent the flute can be used to break enchantments, which
effectively nullifies the effects of all spells and spell-like
abilities (but not Psionics) that belong to the Enchantment school,
whether they are beneficial or not (three charges). Furthermore, the
flute can be used to mimic the effects of any arcane spell from the
Enchantment school (two charges). Finally, the flute can summon forth a
Spirit Warrior (one charge).<br>
<br>
Spirit Warriors are spectral echoes
of past heroes whose souls now rest in the halls of Valhalla. If a bard
agrees to spread stories and songs of their legendary deeds in order to
prevent them from being forgotten, a spirit of one of these valiant
fighters will materialize and join the bard's cause for a short while
(10 rounds). The mere presence of this fabled warrior instills
courage in all nearby allies raising their morale to its highest.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
The Spirit Warrior is actually a spectral undead creature and thus
receives the proper&nbsp;</span><acronym style="font-style: italic;" title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym><span style="font-style: italic;"> spectral undead traits
(vulnerability to any
spells or items which specifically target undead creatures such as Hold
Undead, Repulse Undead, Control Undead, False Dawn and Sunray; immunity
to curative magic, sleep, charm, hold, poison, paralyzation, cold-based spells and
non-magical weapons). For convenience reasons, the Spirit Warrior
cannot be turned, rebuked or controlled by&nbsp;</span><acronym style="font-style: italic;" title="Player Character">PC</acronym><span style="font-style: italic;">
clerics.&nbsp;In
terms of power, the Spirit Warrior should be somewhere in-between an
Elemental Prince and a Deva. However, Spirit Warriors summoned by
Skalds are slightly more powerful than those summoned by other Bards.
Although the Spirit
Warrior cannot be controlled directly by the player, he is treated as
an ally, and the party will receive experience for every kill he makes. </span><br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Resonating_Weapon"></a>Resonating Weapon</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(replaces Evasion)</span><br>
<br>
Bards eventually achieve a high degree of control over sound which
enables them to imbue any weapon with concentrated sound energy for a
short while. A weapon imbued in this fashion resonates with a sharp
tone and deals an extra 2d4 points of sonic damage to its target on
each hit. Furthermore, anyone struck by the resonating weapon must save
vs. breath or become temporarily deafened. After 2 rounds have passed,
the weapon ceases to resonate and the deafness subsides.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Sound_Barrier"></a>Sound
Barrier</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(replaces
Greater Evasion)</span><br>
<br>
The
most skilled of all Bards are able to fully control the intensity,
speed, and direction of the very waves which compose sound, which
allows them to shape and bend it as they see fit. By utilizing this
ability, the Bard encases himself within a sphere of swirling sound
waves thereby forming a barrier which protects him from all sound-based
spells
and attacks (Silence, Deafness, Command/Greater Command, Power Word
(any), Holy/Unholy Word, Wail of the Banshee and Demilich Howl). Anyone
who attempts to break through the barrier and strike the Bard in melee
takes 2d8 points of sonic damage. Furthermore, the attacker may become
deafened (75% chance) or stunned (25% chance) during the following
round unless a save vs. breath is made. The sound barrier dissipates
after 5 rounds.<br>
<br>
Requires: Resonating Weapon<br>

<br>
With cleverness innate to the class, an experienced bard has seen
enough potions in his or her adventuring career to simulate the
creation of one. However, the costs for any raw materials that are used
in the process must be paid. This ability allows a bard to brew one of
the potions from the following list:<br>
<br>
1) Potion of Mind Focusing<br>
2) Potion of Clarity<br>
3) Potion of Regeneration<br>
4) Potion of Defense<br>
5) Potion of Superior Healing<br>
6) Elixir of Health<br>
7) Oil of Speed<br>
8) Potion of Freedom<br>
9) Potion of Frost Giant Strength, only usable by thieves or bards<br>
<br>
Note: brewing potions is a delicate task which can only be undertaken
in safe (non-hostile) areas.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Scribe_Scrolls"></a>Scribe Scrolls</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(revised ability)</span><br>
<br>This ability allows an experienced spellcaster to scribe a spell
from his spellbook onto a scroll. Only a spell that is currently
memorized may be scribed in this manner. Furthermore, the cost of any
raw materials that are used in the process must be covered in full.
Finally, inscribing a scroll removes one instance of the spell in
question from the caster's memory.<br><br>Note: scribing scrolls is a delicate task which can only be undertaken in safe (non-hostile) areas.<br>

<br>
This
component adds more magic items&nbsp;suitable for
Thieves and Bards (bucklers, bardic instruments, hoods, cowls, ioun
stones...etc.) to the game and modifies the Short
Sword of Backstabbing in order to bring it closer to its <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
counterpart. Most of the new equipment can be
purchased from
Marina, the Black Market merchant, who resides on the main floor
of&nbsp;the Shadow Thief guildhall in Athkatla's Dock District.
Besides
adding new equipment, this component also restores several lost items
from&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym>
(i.e. the Dagger of Venom and&nbsp;Kiel's Buckler). In return, a
few of the new items are also available in the&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym> portion of the
game for&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1 to 2">BG1Tutu</acronym>
and&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>
players. Finally, a small quest involving
Arledrian (the fence who resides on the top floor of Gaelan Bayle's
house) will be added as well.&nbsp;<br>

For many generations, this shield was passed down to selected High
Jurists of Amaunator who took upon them the duty of cleansing the lands
of all undead. After Amaunator seemingly disappeared and the Keep of
the Eternal Sun had fallen, the shield's brilliant golden finish began
to fade and its powerful enchantments started to dissolve. Eventually,
the once mighty artifact was degraded to a mere wall decoration. As
time passed, Amaunator's followers slowly fell into disarray and
started to disband. The shield was lastly pillaged from their temple
along with many other relics.<br>

This buckler is made from a darksteel alloy which was tinged with
trace amounts of mithril and silver. Although its surface appears to be
extremely polished, the shield somehow seems to draw in the light,
rather than reflecting it. Upon closer examination, several
enchantments which are commonly attributed to Mask's priesthood can be
detected. It is likely that the Shadowlord himself blessed this item
with his touch, granting it the power to hide and guard his followers

This odd looking shield appears to be entirely made up of large
hardened leaves. The unusual shape and size of the leaves suggests they
once belonged to the ancient oak trees which grow deep within the
Forest of Mir. Upon closer examination, powerful druidic enchantments
can be discovered on the shield's surface. It appears that they
slightly increase the shield bearer's health and make any sustained
wounds heal faster. Every morning, at sunrise, one of the leaves glows
faintly for a moment. It can then be picked and planted into the ground
while another instantly grows back to take its place. After the proper
incantation is spoken, the planted leaf quickly grows into a fearsome
Shambling Mound who's strength and size seem to be directly linked to
the power of the shield bearer.<br>

on the level of the Druid who is wielding it (levels 1-13 a Lesser
Shambler for 12 hours,
levels
14-24 a Shambling Mound for 16 hours, levels 25+ a Greater
Shambler for 24 hours). As per </span><acronym style="font-style: italic;" title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym><span style="font-style: italic;">
rules, Shamblers will seamlessly blend into their natural&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: italic;">surroundings</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> if they are
summoned&nbsp;in swamp, marsh or forest areas. They are also plant
creatures and will thus receive the proper </span><acronym style="font-style: italic;" title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym><span style="font-style: italic;">
plant traits (increased
vulnerability to the Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting spell, immunity to
curative magic, mind-affecting
spells, poison, sleep, paralysis, polymorph, stunning and critical
hits). Besides these basic plant traits, Shamblers are also immune to
lightning, fire and crushing damage and resistant to cold, piercing,
slashing and missile damage. Although the
Shamblers can not
be controlled directly by the player they are treated as allies, and
the party will get experience for every kill which they make. This is
similar to my implementation of the Spirit Warrior or the way that
Bodhi and Balthazar were handled in the Ascension mod. However, if a
Druid summons a Shambler and
then unequipps The Guardian, his mental link with the creature will
break and it will be unsummoned. Attempting to summon Shamblers with
non-druidic characters
(i.e. Thieves or Bards with </span><acronym style="font-style: italic;" title="Use Any Item">UAI</acronym><span style="font-style: italic;">
) will have dire consequences. On the other hand, if The Guardian is
carried by a Druid, its enchantments will be further strengthened as
the shieldbearer becomes more powerful.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

was a bard, of sorts, though less for his love of people than his
hatred of hard work. He bade a mage relation construct this harp so its
magic might disguise his utter lack of talent in the arts. Its power
was greater than he had hoped, and he later turned to petty burglary
using 'his' music to captivate his victims. Greagan ultimately
disappeared some years ago amidst rumors of a bardic college
uncharacteristically moved to violence. The harp still functions,
though any self-respecting troubadour would reserve its use for the
most dire of circumstances.<br>

Lady
Laxaella Bronshield, the Baroness of Tanistan, had this harp fashioned
for her court jester before sending him along with a company of her
best soldiers to deal with the recent Umber Hulk infestation of the
Thornwood forest. At first, the soldiers were surprised that a jester
was to accompany them on this task, merrily mocking his meager physique
and his apparent fatuousness, but after they encountered the first
Umber Hulk they soon realized the true importance of his role. To the
soldier's astonishment, the jester was completely unfazed by the Umber
Hulk's terrible gaze, which simultaneously turned one of their most
steadfast warriors into a stuporing idiot. Furthermore, the odd, quirky
tune which the jester's harp produced somehow seemed to counter the
effect of the monster's gaze, restoring the sanity to the afflicted
soldier. In the end, the infestation was cleansed with no casualties
and only minimal injuries. For the better part of their home trip, the
soldiers carried the jester on their shoulders all the time chanting
praises in his honor.<br>

Calimshite court wizard, who had spent his entire life researching and

wizard studied and familiarized himself with a large number of
enchanted items and mystical objects. Fearful of forgetting important
details, and not trusting the fragile nature of paper, Mirdival
regularly stored his memories into a sensory stone which he had
acquired from a planewalking Fire Genasi merchant. Unfortunately, one
of his experiments went awry, and his whole tower was leveled by the
ensuing explosion. During the towers's collapse, the sensory stone was
shattered into a number of fragments, some of which still retain a
small part of the wizard's memories.<br>

Akram
Maluzar was an infamous Zhentarim wizard obsessed with the secrets of
the ancient Nethril. During his many travels through the Great Waste he
scoured a system of caves which, as he had guessed, interconnected with
a buried Nethrese city. His enthusiasm was somewhat dampened&nbsp;
when
he found out that the ruins were heavily trapped and riddled with
illusionary floors and sturdily locked doors. The ability to pass these
obstacles was beyond Akram's skill, so he grew desperate. Not wanting
to share the power of the Nethrese with anyone else, Akram chose to
steal the very talents he lacked instead. Promising them a great share
of the treasure, the wizard hired three exceptionally skilled
Calimshite thieves - an expert locksmith, a shady trapmaster and a
keen-eyed scout. Instead of sending them to the ancient city, Akram
tricked the thieves and imprisoned their souls inside a Sapphire Ioun
Stone, thus enchanting it with the traits which he sought. The
procedure worked, and at first he was able to delve deep into the ruins
without hindrance. Eventually however, the souls of the three thieves
confined within the Ioun Stone began rebelling and started draining the
wizard's health in an attempt to reclaim his body as their own. Driven
by his lust for power Akram paid little heed to his condition until it
was too late. Terribly fatigued, he collapsed in front of a ruined
Nethrese library, and thereby accidentally activated a hidden trap
which caused a cave in and claimed his life. Akram's prized Ioun Stone
was later recovered by a wandering tribe of kobolds who mistook it for
a simple jewel and traded it for supplies.<br>

Dark
orcish runes are etched into this club. It is a remnant of the last war
between the orcs and the Turmish wizards. When the orcish tribes
started raiding their city the wizards created golems of terrible power
to protect them. Sensing that the brute strength of his warriors was
not enough, the great orc chieftain Gull-Nar ordered his shamans to
craft a weapon that would allow him to smash the "living statues" into
rubble. His shamans used the books from a raided wizard tower to
enchant the favorite weapon of their chieftain, a great war club.
Gull-Nar was so pleased that he decided to personally lead the next
raid, smashing the golems into bits as he proceeded toward the city
core. Victory was near but then a lone mage dressed in black appeared
out of nowhere and cast a powerful spell which caused the raging orcs
to turn upon each other. In mere minutes their numbers were decimated
and Gull-Nar himself was killed by his most trusted warriors.<br>

It is rumored that a cunning priestess of Auril created dozens of
these darts in order to provide her temple guards with a weapon of last
resort. A dart seemed perfect for the task since it was very easy to
conceal. Minor enchantments which cause frost burns and return the dart
to the wielder's hand after striking were added as well. In general,
such weapons are rarely seen outside of Auril's temples which are
commonly located on the snow covered peeks of Icewind Dale. However, in
the recent years, a few merchants from the Ten Towns region have been
acquiring suspiciously large quantities of these darts from local
adventuring parties.<br>

The
lavish, fiery runes etched into the hilt of this dagger indicate that
it was crafted in Thay, presumably for a high ranking member of the
Researcher faction. Although the blade may be used by anyone skilled
enough to wield it, only those who are versed in the arcane arts can
unlock its true potential. The tiny weapon appears to have been imbued
with an enchantment which sharpens the mind of its wielder, providing
greater acuteness and thereby enhancing the spell memorization
capabilities of arcane spellcasters.<br>

At first glance this roughly crafted, rust covered dagger seems
like a very odd choice for a weapon. Only the old goblin runes notched
along the blade reveal some of its power and history. Apparently, this
weapon was originally a torture device of a powerful goblin shaman
called Sharnuk, who above all else sought the knowledge of higher
wizardry. Sharnuk's tribe often ambushed lone mages in their sleep and
brought them to their leader so that he could rob them of their
secrets. During the interrogations, Sharnuk would meticulously stab at
his victims until they either became weakened by magical afflictions
induced by the blade or simply delirious from the loss of blood. In
such a state, it was easy for him to pry the knowledge that he sought
from a mage's mind. When he believed that he had acquired enough power,
Sharnuk led his tribe to a raid on a nearby gnomish settlement.
However, luck was not on his side that day, as he and his entire cohort
were scorched to death when he attempted to cast his first fireball.<br>

This
dagger was forged from purest silver and blessed by Sehanine Moonbow,
the elven goddess of the moon. Its blade is especially potent against
vampires as it was enchanted to channel any stray bits of power from
the Positive Energy plane. Each day the weapon amasses a small amount
of positive energy which the wielder can use as a shield against the
soul-draining claws of a vampire. Furthermore, any vampire struck by
the dagger may become stunned from contact with the stored energy.<br>

<br>
The
winter of
1228. was particularly hard on the halfling settlements near Shalebrook
forest. The last few years were harsh, and food was very
scarce.&nbsp; The situation was worsened further by the troll raids
which had become more frequent due to the famine which was spreading
throught the whole region. Although inferior in numbers, their great
strength and resilience allowed the trolls to mercilessly seize the
halflings' very last supplies. However, the fair food of the small folk
could not settle their immense hunger and the trolls soon started
feeding on the healthier halflings. Outraged, The head of the halfling
settlement tried to call for help, but as the main roads were snowed in
and the outer paths lead through the troll-infested forest, no
immediate support could arrive. One morning, after the trolls took his
own sister, a young rogue named Lars the Lightfooted grew desperate.
The following night, he gathered all his courage and somehow snuck
through the forest full of trolls. With the last ounce of his strength,
he managed to reach a nearby dwarven settlement. He begged the dwarves
to help him, but due to their own problems with the ongoing orc
invasion, they could only offer him some of their spare weapons and
supplies. Devastated, Lars grabbed the only weapon he knew how to
wield, a dagger, and left. Lady Tymora smiled on him that day, for he
had unintentionally picked a weapon which would soon save his life. As
he rushed back through the forest the loud snoring of the trolls hinted
him to the cave where they were sleeping. The sight of gnawed halfling
bones scattered around the entrance was the final straw. Blindly
rushing inside, Lars viciously stabbed at the nearest sleeping troll
with the dwarven dagger, oblivious to the risk to his life, his
thoughts going to his beloved sister. To his amazement, the troll he
had struck screamed in agony as his horrid body started melting and
dissolving into a puddle of goo. The rest of the trolls woke up, but
the sight of their melting comrade and the strong smell of acid brought
such immense fear to them that they immediately ran away, never to
return again to Shalebrook forest again. Still in shock, Lars slowly
recomposed himself and freed his sister and the other captured

halflings. Eventually, Lars the Lightfooted was proclaimed the Savior
of Shalebrook, and his weapon was given the name Trollmelter. <br>

<br>
<cite>"Short sword of
Backstabbing: In
the hands of any character this is a +2 magical weapon, but in the
hands of a thief it is especially potent. When a thief makes a backstab
attempt with this short sword, it allows him to attack as if four
levels higher than his actual experience level, with corresponding
improvements in <acronym title="To Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym>,
attack rolls, and damage multiplier on a
successful hit."</cite><br>
<br>
Based on that, the
Baldur's Gate 2 version of the item was altered in the following manner:<br>
<br>
The Shadow's Blade was created to be the perfect assassin's
tool.&nbsp; It is highly sought after by any who settle differences
with a blade, and many that possess it do not do so for long.&nbsp;
In
the hands of any character this sword acts as a standard +3 magical
weapon, but in the hands of a Thief it becomes especially potent
granting him an additional bonus to hit and increasing his backstab

The
profession of a ninja is very versatile, some are skilled assassins
while others excel at the art of stealth and thievery. The owner of
this blade undoubtedly belonged to the second group. Her true name
remains a mystery, though she was known as The Black Cat, an infamous
thief renown for acquiring rare commodities for and from the upper
class circles of the Kara-Tur nobility. It was not unusual for her to
steal a precious jewel from the collection of one noble, sell it to
another wealthy aristocrat and then steal it back merely for the thrill
of the deed. For her mischiefs, the Black Cat was hunted by many famous
Kara-Tur warriors, but through a combination of luck and extraordinary
acrobatic skill, she always managed to evade her pursuers. Eventually,
as the story goes, she fell in love with a particularly persistent
samurai and left her country and her former life together with him.<br>

This
blade once belonged Lao-Tzu, a samurai from one of the southern
provinces of Kara-Tur. Upon finishing his training the warrior had
sworn an oath to finally free his lands from the bandits and brigands
which had plagued his people for the last ten years. However, that task
proved fairly difficult as his opponents were cunning, and only struck
late at night, always wearing hoods and masks. Lao-Tzu understood that
these bandits had no honor and that may well be hiding among the very
people which he sought to protect, but he dared not act merely on
impulse for his code of conduct would not permit him to falsely accuse
an innocent. To aid him in this task, Lao-Tzu sought a great Wu Jen
master and asked him to enchant his wakizashi with the ability to sense
the true intentions of a person and to strike vigorously against those
without honor. The samurai organized a feast for the people in order to
lift the spirits of the robbed ones and to drive out the bandits into
the open. The people answered his call and Lao-Tzu was pleased. Using
the power of his new weapon he managed to separate the cunning bandits
from the simple peasants and to seat them inside a separate dining
hall. Once they were all rounded up, the samurai barred the only exit
and fought alone against a dozen rogues. After a short battle Lao-Tzu
emerged victorious, but his honor did not allow him to kill even such
unworthy foes. Instead, the samurai exiled the bandits from the
province and his people finally knew peace.<br>

summoning
the
guards in case a party member loots a container in their vicinity.
Furthermore, this component will also prevent the
effects of Potions of Master Thievery and Potions of Perception from
stacking&nbsp;(in case of multiple uses) and can optionally replace
them with their&nbsp;corresponding <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
counterparts.&nbsp;Since the <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
versions of these potions are somewhat different from their&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2">BG2</acronym>
counterparts,&nbsp;their full description is included here:<br>

This
potion grants a temporary increase in thieving skills and maximum hit
points to a rogue if he has fewer than 13 levels of experience. The
bonus diminishes as the rogue advances in levels and completely
disappears once he masters the art of thievery on his own.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Revised_merchant_behavior_on_failed"></a>Revised&nbsp;</span><acronym style="font-weight: bold;" title="Nonplayer character">NPC</acronym><span style="font-weight: bold;"> behavior on failed theft attempts</span><br>
<br>
In
the unmodded game, a merchant would instantly turn hostile
&nbsp;(and
often try to attack a fully equipped, combat-ready party) whenever a
party member failed to steal an item from his store. Similarly, neutral, non-joinable <acronym title="Nonplayer character">NPCs</acronym> would simply turn hostile after a failed pickpocket attempt.
This component alters that behavior as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>Merchants will no longer
turn hostile after a failed theft attempt. They will instead opt to
report the theft to their superiors (thereby lowering the party's
reputation) and refuse to have any further dealings with the party</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>
can now talk his way out of a failed theft/pickpocket attempt if one of his mental
attributes and/or Lore and Reputation score is high enough</li>
<li>Neutral, non-joinable <acronym title="Nonplayer character">NPCs</acronym> will now initiate a special dialogue
after a failed pickpocket attempt rather than simply turn hostile</li><li>If a familiar fails a pickpocket check against a non-hostile&nbsp;<acronym title="Nonplayer character">NPC</acronym>
it will be reprimanded (which will make it run around in panic for a short while)<acronym title="Nonplayer character"></acronym></li>
</ul>
In summary, whenever you fail a theft or a pickpocket attempt, you now
get various
dialogue options for dealing with the situation depending on your
Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Lore and Reputation scores. The initial
requirements are fairly low (12 for either of the mental attributes, 20
for Lore, 14 for good Reputation and 7 for bad Reputation). However,
each&nbsp;<acronym title="Nonplayer character">NPC</acronym> keeps track of how many times you've tried to talk your
way out of a theft, and the aforementioned requirements exponentially
rise
with every further failed attempt. Also, even with the highest
attribute scores, you can have no more than 3 botched theft attempts
per&nbsp;<acronym title="Nonplayer character">NPC</acronym>. After that, no amount of talking will be able to convince
that particular&nbsp;<acronym title="Nonplayer character">NPC</acronym> of your "innocence". Lastly, this component&nbsp;allows parties with a high reputation and party
members with a charisma score above 10 to pay a fine to various law
enforcers (Flaming Fist, Amnish Centurions, Saradush Militia) after a
failed theft attempt instead of having to face them in combat. The
amount of gold that needs to be paid depends on the party's reputation
or the charisma score of the party member who had committed the theft.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
