The game.tra files in these subdirectories are UTF8 encoded, for EE
games.

Main differences:
  No usability information in item descriptions.
  Kit descriptions match the EE format (at least for English).

They should contain no redundant strings (strings that differ only in
encoding), apart from non-English kit descriptions.
