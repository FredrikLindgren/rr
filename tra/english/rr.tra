@24 = ~The Guardian~
@25 = ~This odd-looking shield appears to be entirely made up of large, hardened leaves. The unusual shape and size of the leaves suggests they once belonged to the ancient oak trees which grow deep within the Forest of Mir. Upon closer examination, powerful druidic enchantments can be discovered on the shield's surface. It appears that they slightly increase the shieldbearer's health and make any sustained wounds heal faster. Every morning, at sunrise, one of the leaves glows faintly for a moment. It can then be picked and planted into the ground while another instantly grows back to take its place. After the proper incantation is spoken, the planted leaf quickly grows into a fearsome Shambling Mound whose strength and size appear to be directly linked to the power of the shieldbearer.

STATISTICS:

    +5 to maximum hit points
     Shieldbearer regenerates 1 hit point per round

@26 = ~Rogue's Ward~
@27 = ~This buckler is made from a darksteel alloy which was tinged with trace amounts of mithril and silver. Although its surface appears to be extremely polished, the shield somehow seems to draw light in, rather than reflecting it. Upon closer examination, several enchantments which are commonly attributed to Mask's priesthood can be detected. It is likely that the Shadowlord himself blessed this item with his touch, granting it the power to hide and guard his followers from any dangers which they may encounter in their risky professions.

STATISTICS:

Equipped Abilities:
    +2 bonus to all saves vs. death
    +10% to Hide in Shadows

 Bard~

@28 = ~SWASHBUCKLER: This rogue is part acrobat, part swordsman and part wit: the epitome of charm and grace.

Advantages:
-  Gains +1 bonus to armor class for every 5 levels
-  Uses the Fighter's THAC0 progression table while wielding melee weapons
-  Can specialize in any melee weapon that a thief can use
-  Can acquire the Whirlwind ability at higher levels
-  Can acquire the Insightful Strike ability at higher levels

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot backstab
-  Cannot dual-class to a Fighter
-  Cannot acquire the Assassination ability
-  Cannot acquire the Crippling Strike ability~

@29 = ~BARD: The bard is also a rogue, but he is very different from the thief. His strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack of all trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere and are often inspirational to the listeners. A bard can rally his allies by singing heroic songs or weaving inspiring tales about how his companions will overcome their foes and win the day. The effect of the bard's song varies according to his level:

1st:   +1 to hit and all saving throws, song raises morale
9th:   +2 to hit and all saving throws, song removes fear
18th:  +3 to hit and all saving throws, song protects from fear~

@30 = ~BLADE: The Blade is an expert fighter and adventurer whose bardic acting abilities make him appear more intimidating and fearsome. If there is a showy way to wield or perform with a weapon, a Blade knows how to do it better than anyone. Blades often perform amazing displays of skill and control as they whirl various weapons about their bodies with deadly precision. The weapons of a Blade are always kept in perfect condition and highly polished for maximum effect during a battle or a performance. Blades regularly train and perform with weapons in both hands, eventually developing complete ambidexterity.

Advantages:
-  May use the Offensive Spin and Defensive Spin abilities once per day per 4 levels
-  May use the Weapons Display ability once per day per 10 levels
-  Obtains maximum proficiency in two weapon fighting style at first level
-  Can acquire the Whirlwind ability at higher levels

Disadvantages:
-  Only has one-half normal Lore value
-  Only has one-half Pick Pockets percentage
-  Battlesong does not improve with levels
-  Cannot acquire the Enhanced Battlesong ability
-  Cannot acquire the Lingering Song ability

Offensive Spin: 
This ability lasts for 24 seconds and grants the Blade +2 bonus to hit and damage and an extra attack. All of the Blade's attacks do maximum damage for the duration.

Defensive Spin: 
This ability lasts for 24 seconds and grants the Blade a +1 bonus to Armor Class per each level of experience, up to a maximum of 10. The Blade cannot move away from the initial spot while performing a Defensive Spin.

Weapons Display:
By whirling a melee weapon about his body a Blade can affect the morale and courage of others. Such a display of skill, precision, and deadly grace lowers opponents' morale (enemies must save vs. spell to avoid morale failure) and simultaneously inspires allies, granting a +1 bonus to their attack rolls. The display must occur for a full round without interruption. During this time, any successful attack upon the Blade or failed saving throw by the Blade disrupts the display. Weapons Display is an extraordinary (non-magical) ability, therefore it completely ignores any magic resistance of the subject creatures. Undead, Constructs, Slimes, Animals and Demonic creatures are completely unaffected by the Weapons Display. Furthermore, the ability cannot affect creatures whose total Hit Dice exceed the Blade's current level and creatures with more than 20 Hit Dice are completely unaffected. The effectiveness and the duration of this ability improve as the Blade gains more levels. The bonus granted to the attack rolls of allies and the saving throw penalty for the enemies increase by one point per ten experience levels of the Blade. The effects of Weapons Display last for one round per each level of the Blade.~

@31 = ~Weapons Display~

@32 = ~JESTER: This bard is well versed in the arts of ridicule and hilarity and uses his abilities to distract, confuse and mesmerize his enemies, cavorting madly during combat. Many sages believe that Jesters live in a constant state of borderline insanity. It's known that they crave for attention and feel at ease only when they are the focus of events. All Jesters are chaotically aligned, since no mind attuned to law and order could possibly sustain such an odd personality. Due to their peculiar fighting style, Jesters tend to avoid large and unwieldy weapons.

Advantages:
-  Gains Jester's Song at first level. This ability further improves at 9th and 18th level
-  Gains Fool's Luck and Chaotic Mind as passive traits at first level

Disadvantages:
-  Can only become proficient with weapons that are usable by the Thief class
-  Must be Chaotically aligned
-  Battlesong doesn't help allies

Jester's Song:
A Jester's Song doesn't help allies. Instead, it distracts every opponent within hearing range. The effect of the song further improves as the Jester gains more levels:

1st:   Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (+4 save bonus)
9th:   Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (+2 save bonus) and confused (+4 save bonus)
18th:  Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (no save bonus), confused (+2 save bonus) and mesmerized (+4 save bonus)

Distracted opponents have a 20% chance of spellcasting failure and suffer a 2 point penalty to their THAC0 and AC. Confused opponents either go berserk and attack the nearest creature, stand still and babble incoherently or wander about aimlessly. Mesmerized opponents have their flow of thoughts disrupted to such an extent that they are unable to take any rational actions while listening to Jester's song, which effectively incapacitates them. However, even in that state opponents can still perceive danger on a subconscious level, so any hostile action taken against them automatically breaks this effect. The Jester's song has no effect on mindless creatures such as Constructs, Skeletons, Zombies and Slimes.

Fool's Luck:
Jesters are careless, foolish and given to whimsical decisions, yet they seem to possess some uncanny ability which allows them to survive in almost any situation. Fool's Luck adds a +1 bonus to the Jester's base Armor Class, a +1 bonus to all of his saving throws and a +5% bonus to his pickpocket skill checks.

Chaotic Mind:
Due to their unique mindset, Jesters are innately immune to the effects of spells, items and abilities that cause Confusion.~

@33 = ~SKALD: This Nordic bard is also a warrior of great strength, skill and virtue. His songs are inspiring sagas of battle and valor, and the Skald devotes his life to those pursuits. Skalds are honored and respected as great warrior-poets who memorize the feats of each raid and battle, setting them down in the form of poetry. Spells are nearly unknown in the Skald's society and they are viewed with suspicion in any event. Using magic is slightly more difficult for a Skald and requires additional time and effort.

Advantages:
-  Gains Skald's Song at first level. This ability further improves at 9th and 18th level
-  Gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage with all weapons at first level

Disadvantages:
-  Pick pockets ability one-quarter normal
-  Suffers a 1-point penalty to spellcasting speed

Skald's Song:
By chanting a war song, a Skald can inspire allies as they go forward into combat. Chanting can elevate spirits, remove concerns about danger, keep men's minds focused on combat and fill friendly forces with a sense of being larger than life. The effects of the song further improve as the Skald gains more levels:

1st:  gives allies +2 to hit, +2 to damage, -2 to AC and immunity to Fear
9th:  gives allies +3 to hit, +3 to damage, -3 to AC, immunity to Fear and Confusion
18th: gives allies +4 to hit, +4 to damage, -4 to AC, immunity to Fear, Stun and Confusion.~


@34 = ~Tracking
With an intimate knowledge of his surroundings and the creatures that live within them, a Ranger or a Bounty Hunter can use the Tracking ability to give himself a general idea of what creatures are in an area and which direction they are. Red arrows at the edge of the screen will point in the general direction of the creatures in the area.~

@35 = ~ASSASSIN: This is a killer specialized in discreet and efficient murder, relying on anonymity and surprise to perform his task. Training in anatomy, stealth and poison use allows an Assassin to carry out missions of death with terrifying precision. A clever Assassin might never be seen by his victim.

Advantages:
-  May use Poison Weapon once per day at 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter
-  Acquires Poison Expertise at 8th level. This ability further improves every 8 levels thereafter
-  May use Death Attack once per day at 16th level and every 8 levels thereafter
-  Backstab reaches x7 instead of x5

Disadvantages:
-  Only 15% per level to distribute on abilities
-  Must be of evil or neutral alignment

Poison Weapon:
Due to the requirements of his profession, an Assassin becomes adapt at coating his weapons in poison early during his career. Any weapon prepared in this manner will deal an extra 1d3 points of poison damage upon contact. Furthermore, unless a saving throw vs. poison is made, the poison will be injected into the bloodstream of the victim, dealing one additional point of damage per each level of the Assassin (up to a maximum of 20). The poison coating evaporates after 5 rounds. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures cannot be poisoned.

Poison Expertise
Through training and experience, an Assassin gradually learns to utilize poison more effectively. Furthermore, due to the constant exposure to poison an Assassin slowly becomes desensitized towards it. Each time this ability is acquired, the Assassin gains a permanent +1 bonus to his saving throws vs. poison. At the same time, the saving throw difficulty class of his Poison Weapon ability improves by 1.

Death Attack:
By thoroughly studying the weak spots of his victim, an Assassin can focus all of his cunning and prowess into a single, deadly strike. The next attack he makes automatically becomes a critical hit and his victim must make a saving throw vs. death or die instantly. As the Assassin gains more experience, the lethality of the Death Attack increases. The victim saves with a -1 penalty at level 24, a -2 penalty at level 32 and a -3 penalty at level 40. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures cannot be slain by a Death Attack.~

@36 = ~Death Attack~
@37 = ~Attempting a Death Attack~
@38 = ~Set Alchemical Trap~

@40 = ~Mass Charm~
@41 = ~Mass Charm

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 30-feet radius
Saving Throw: Special

An experienced Bard eventually learns to influence the actions of his opponents. By focusing his willpower a Bard can suggest a course of activity which opponents feel strongly compelled to follow. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out and break the enchantment. If a common language is shared, the Bard can generally force the subjects to perform as he desires, within the limits of their abilities. If no common language is shared, the character can communicate only by using basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," "Stand still" etc. Opponents can attempt a saving throw vs. spells in order to avoid being controlled, but even if they succeed, there is still a 25% chance that they will suffer a mental breakdown from the amount of stress that their minds have suffered. This will effectively cause them to enter a Berserk state (no save) and attack the nearest creature for one round.

Being non-magical in nature, this ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, it has no effect on mindless creatures such as Constructs, Skeletons, Zombies and Slimes. The racial charm resistance of Elves and Half-Elves also applies.~

@42 = ~Enthralling Melody~
@43 = ~Enthralling Melody

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 30-feet radius
Saving Throw: Special

By softly humming a catchy tune, an experienced Bard can captivate and enthrall any audience, even creatures that do not understand his language. Opponents in the area of effect must successfully save vs. paralyzation or give the Bard their undivided attention, totally ignoring their surroundings and becoming fascinated for the following five rounds. Fascinated creatures can take no actions for the duration of the effect, however, they can still perceive danger on a subconscious level, so any hostile action taken against them automatically breaks this state. In addition, even if opponents make their saving throws and avoid the fascination effect, there is still a 25% chance that they will become confused for one round (no save) from being too deeply immersed into the hypnotic pattern of the song.

Being non-magical in nature, this ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, it has no effect on mindless creatures such as Constructs, Skeletons, Zombies and Slimes.~

@44 = ~Sound Burst~
@45 = ~Sound Burst

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-feet radius
Saving Throw: Special

The Bard magically amplifies the capabilities of a musical instrument in order to fill his surroundings with high-pitched, stone-shattering sound waves. Creatures in the nearby area take 15d6 points of sonic damage and are also deafened for five rounds. Deafened creatures suffer a 50% chance of spellcasting failure. A successful save vs. breath halves the damage and negates the deafness.

Being non-magical in nature, this ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, resistance to energy damage can reduce the amount of damage dealt.~

@46 = ~Magic Flute

This ability creates an enchanted flute made of pure magical energy which remains in existence for 8 hours. When played by a bard of exceptional talent the flute can be used to break enchantments, which effectively nullifies the effects of all spells and spell-like abilities (but not Psionics) that belong to the Enchantment school, whether they are beneficial or not (three charges). Furthermore, the flute can be used to mimic the effects of any arcane spell from the Enchantment school (two charges). Finally, the flute can summon forth a Spirit Warrior (one charge).

Spirit Warriors are spectral echoes of past heroes whose souls now rest in the halls of Valhalla. If a bard agrees to spread stories and songs of their legendary deeds in order to prevent them from being forgotten, a spirit of one of these valiant fighters will materialize and join the bard's cause for a short while (10 rounds). The mere presence of this fabled warrior instills courage in all nearby allies, raising their morale to its highest.~

@47 = ~Enhanced Bard Song~
@48 = ~Enhanced Bard Song

This mighty battle chant grants the Bard and his allies +4 to hit, +4 to all saving throws, +10% bonus to magic resistance and immunity to Fear and Charm. The Bard himself receives an 8-point bonus to all of his saving throws while singing the song.~

@49 = ~Enhanced Skald Song~
@50 = ~Enhanced Skald Song

This mighty battle chant grants the Skald and his allies +5 to hit, +5 to damage, -5 to AC, +10% resistance to physical damage, immunity to Fear, Stun and Confusion. The Skald himself receives a 10-point bonus to his armor class while singing the song.~

@51 = ~Enhanced Jester Song~
@52 = ~Enhanced Jester Song

The Enhanced Jester Song affects all opponents within hearing range who must save vs. spells once per round or become distracted (-2 save penalty) confused (no save bonus) or mesmerized (+2 save bonus). The Jester himself becomes immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities while singing the song.~

@53 = ~The dagger of venom is a potent blade favored by assassins all across the Realms.  This particular dagger of venom was created for use by the Shadow Thieves of Amn.  Every time it hits an opponent it secretes a venom into the blood stream of the creature unless a save vs. death is made.  The venom works quickly and efficiently.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
   15 additional points of poison damage (1 per second) on each hit, save vs. death for none

Damage:  1D4 + 2
THAC0:  +2 bonus

@54 = ~BOUNTY HUNTER:
This is a hunter of men, skilled in tracking and capturing quarry, whether for lawful authorities or underworld masters. Due to the frequent need to bring his prey back alive, a Bounty Hunter often relies on alchemical substances that can incapacitate or weaken his victims. A Bounty Hunter's trap-making abilities are also well beyond those of the average thief.

Advantages:
-  Gains a +15% bonus to the Set Traps skill at 1st level
-  May use Paralytic Toxin once per day at 1st level and every 10 levels thereafter
-  Can lay Alchemical Traps in addition to regular snares
-  Acquires Alchemical Expertise at 10th level. This ability further improves every 10 levels thereafter
-  Can acquire the Tracking ability at higher levels

Disadvantages:
-  Gets only 20% to distribute between thief abilities at each level

Paralytic Toxin:
The Bounty Hunter's intricate understanding of alchemy and herbalism allows him to create a substance that causes severe loss of muscular function when injected into the bloodstream. This paralytic toxin is a transparent, odorless liquid which can be easily applied to weapons without fear of detection. A hit from any weapon coated in this substance causes the target to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or become paralyzed for one round per every ten levels of the Bounty Hunter. However, the toxin evaporates quickly when exposed to air, making the coating last only a single round. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures are unaffected by the Paralytic Toxin.

Alchemical Traps:
Combining his superior trap-setting skills with his alchemical knowledge, a Bounty Hunter can create traps that are primarily designed for incapacitating his opponents, rather than killing them outright. The effects of the traps vary according to the Bounty Hunter's level, but always last for five rounds and can be negated by a successful saving throw vs. breath:

1st:  trap deals 2d4 points of subdual damage and dazzles the target
6th:  trap deals 4d4 points of subdual damage and slows the target
11th: trap deals 6d4 points of subdual damage and entangles the target
16th: trap deals 8d4 points of subdual damage and blinds the target
21st: trap deals 10d4 points of subdual damage and renders the target unconscious

Note: subdual damage is non-lethal and will render the target unconscious if its hit points drop below 0, instead of killing it. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures are immune to subdual damage.

Alchemical Expertise
Through training and experience, a Bounty Hunter gradually learns to utilize alchemical substances more effectively. Each time this ability is acquired, the saving throw difficulty class of the Bounty Hunter's Paralytic Toxin and Alchemical Traps improves by 1.~

@55 = ~Paralytic Toxin~

@56 = ~Lyre of Progression~
@57 = ~The Lyre of Progression was created by the bard Sedini Paletto.  Sedini was a teacher of young, aspiring bards during difficult times.  This instrument, held close at all times, helped Sedini fight off those who would attack him or his students.  When Sedini grew old, he passed it on to his best student, Galwen Alaman.  Galwen continued teaching for a few years before setting out into the wilderness on a life of adventure.  It is believed that he lost the lyre when he accidentally dropped it in a marsh.

STATISTICS:

Held under the left arm, this instrument allows a bard to memorize two extra second-level spells and an extra third-level spell.

Only Usable By:
  Bards~


@58 = ~Returning Frost Dart~
@59 = ~It is rumored that a cunning priestess of Auril created dozens of these darts in order to provide her temple guards with a weapon of last resort. A dart seemed perfect for the task since it was very easy to conceal. Minor enchantments which cause frost burns and return the dart to the wielder's hand after striking were added as well. In general, such weapons are rarely seen outside of Auril's temples, which are commonly located on the snow-covered peeks of Icewind Dale. However, in the recent years, several merchants from the Ten Towns region have been acquiring suspiciously large quantities of these darts from local adventuring parties.

In the hands of any character this sword acts as a standard +3 magical weapon, but in the hands of a Thief it becomes especially potent, granting him an additional bonus to hit and increasing his backstab multiplier.

Rumors say that it was originally a piece of the sensory stone used by Mirdival the Astute, a Calimshite court wizard, who had spent his entire life researching and crafting magical artifacts for his Pasha. During his many travels, the wizard studied and familiarized himself with a large number of enchanted items and mystical objects. Fearful of forgetting important details, and not trusting the fragile nature of paper, Mirdival regularly stored his memories into a sensory stone which he had acquired from a planewalking Fire Genasi merchant. Unfortunately, one of his experiments went awry, and his whole tower was leveled by the ensuing explosion. During the towers's collapse, the sensory stone was shattered into a number of fragments, some of which still retain a small part of the wizard's memories.

@120 = ~Trollmelter~
@121 = ~The winter of 1228. was particularly hard on the halfling settlements near Shalebrook forest. The last few years were harsh, and food was very scarce.  The situation was worsened further by the troll raids which had become more frequent due to the famine which was spreading throught the whole region. Although inferior in numbers, their great strength and resilience allowed the trolls to mercilessly seize the halflings' very last supplies. However, the fair food of the small folk could not settle their immense hunger and the trolls soon started feeding on the healthier halflings. Outraged, The head of the halfling settlement tried to call for help, but as the main roads were snowed in and the outer paths lead through the troll-infested forest, no immediate support could arrive. One morning, after the trolls took his own sister, a young rogue named Lars the Lightfooted grew desperate. The following night, he gathered all his courage and somehow snuck through the forest full of trolls. With the last ounce of his strength, he managed to reach a nearby dwarven settlement. He begged the dwarves to help him, but due to their own problems with the ongoing orc invasion, they could only offer him some of their spare weapons and supplies. Devastated, Lars grabbed the only weapon he knew how to wield, a dagger, and left. Lady Tymora smiled on him that day, for he had unintentionally picked a weapon which would soon save his life. As he rushed back through the forest the loud snoring of the trolls hinted him to the cave where they were sleeping. The sight of gnawed halfling bones scattered around the entrance was the final straw. Blindly rushing inside, Lars viciously stabbed at the nearest sleeping troll with the dwarven dagger, oblivious to the risk to his life, his thoughts going to his beloved sister. To his amazement, the troll he had struck screamed in agony as his horrid body started melting and dissolving into a puddle of goo. The rest of the trolls woke up, but the sight of their melting comrade and the strong smell of acid brought such immense fear to them that they immediately ran away, never to return to Shalebrook forest again. Still in shock, Lars slowly recomposed himself and freed his sister and the other captured halflings. Eventually, Lars the Lightfooted was proclaimed the Savior of Shalebrook, and his weapon was given the name Trollmelter.

@125 = ~At first glance this roughly crafted, rust-covered dagger seems like a very odd choice for a weapon. Only the old goblin runes notched along the blade reveal some of its power and history. Apparently, this weapon was originally a torture device of a powerful goblin shaman called Sharnuk, who above all else sought the knowledge of higher wizardry. Sharnuk's tribe often ambushed lone mages in their sleep and brought them to their leader so that he could rob them of their secrets. During the interrogations, Sharnuk would meticulously stab at his victims until they either became weakened by magical afflictions induced by the blade or simply delirious from the loss of blood. In such a state, it was easy for him to pry the knowledge that he sought from a mage's mind. When he believed that he had acquired enough power, Sharnuk led his tribe to a raid on a nearby gnomish settlement. However, luck was not on his side that day, as he and his entire cohort were scorched to death when he attempted to cast his first fireball.

Upon finishing his training the warrior had sworn an oath to finally free his lands from the bandits and brigands which had plagued his people for the last ten years. However, that task proved fairly difficult as his opponents were cunning, and only struck late at night, always wearing hoods and masks. Lao-Tzu understood that these bandits had no honor and that may well be hiding among the very people which he sought to protect, but he dared not act merely on impulse for his code of conduct would not permit him to falsely accuse an innocent. To aid him in this task, Lao-Tzu sought a great Wu Jen master and asked him to enchant his wakizashi with the ability to sense the true intentions of a person and to strike vigorously against those without honor. The samurai organized a feast for the people in order to lift the spirits of the robbed ones and to drive out the bandits into the open. The people answered his call and Lao-Tzu was pleased. Using the power of his new weapon he managed to separate the cunning bandits from the simple peasants and to seat them inside a separate dining hall. Once they were all rounded up, the samurai barred the only exit and fought alone against a dozen rogues. After a short battle Lao-Tzu emerged victorious, but his honor did not allow him to kill even such unworthy foes. Instead, the samurai exiled the bandits from the province and his people finally knew peace.

The owner of this blade undoubtedly belonged to the second group. Her true name remains a mystery, though she was known as The Black Cat, an infamous thief renowned for acquiring rare commodities for and from the upper-class circles of the Kara-Tur nobility. It was not unusual for her to steal a precious jewel from the collection of one noble, sell it to another wealthy aristocrat and then steal it back merely for the thrill of the deed. For her mischiefs, the Black Cat was hunted by many famous Kara-Tur warriors, but through a combination of luck and extraordinary acrobatic skill, she always managed to evade her pursuers. Eventually, as the story goes, she fell in love with a particularly persistent samurai and left her country and her former life together with him.

When the orcish tribes started raiding their city the wizards created golems of terrible power to protect them. Sensing that the brute strength of his warriors was not enough, the great orc chieftain Gull-Nar ordered his shamans to craft a weapon that would allow him to smash the "living statues" into rubble. His shamans used the books from a raided wizard tower to enchant the favorite weapon of their chieftain, a great war club. Gull-Nar was so pleased that he decided to personally lead the next raid, smashing the golems into bits as he proceeded toward the city core. Victory was near, but then a lone mage dressed in black appeared out of nowhere and cast a powerful spell which caused the raging orcs to turn upon each other. In mere minutes, their numbers were decimated and Gull-Nar himself was killed by his most trusted warriors.

@139 = ~Akram Maluzar was an infamous Zhentarim wizard obsessed with the secrets of the ancient Nethril. During his many travels through the Great Waste he scoured a system of caves which, as he had guessed, interconnected with a buried Nethrese city. His enthusiasm was somewhat dampened  when he found out that the ruins were heavily trapped and riddled with illusionary floors and sturdily locked doors. The ability to pass these obstacles was beyond Akram's skill, so he grew desperate. Not wanting to share the power of the Nethrese with anyone else, Akram chose to steal the very talents he lacked instead. Promising them a great share of the treasure, the wizard hired three exceptionally skilled Calimshite thieves - an expert locksmith, a shady trapmaster and a keen-eyed scout. Instead of sending them to the ancient city, Akram tricked the thieves and imprisoned their souls inside a Sapphire Ioun Stone, thus enchanting it with the traits which he sought. The procedure worked, and at first he was able to delve deep into the ruins without hindrance. Eventually however, the souls of the three thieves confined within the Ioun Stone began rebelling and started draining the wizard's health in an attempt to reclaim his body as their own. Driven by his lust for power Akram paid little heed to his condition until it was too late. Terribly fatigued, he collapsed in front of a ruined Nethrese library, and thereby accidentally activated a hidden trap which caused a cave in and claimed his life. Akram's prized Ioun Stone was later recovered by a wandering tribe of kobolds who mistook it for a simple jewel and traded it for supplies.

Note: In order to gain the knowledge necessary to use the abilities which this item provides, the wearer must actually dive into the consciousness of the trapped souls. This process can be very straining, and using these abilities causes progressively more and more fatigue. The more one uses these abilities, the more fatigue one accumulates.

This finely made harp is well known among the nomadic peoples of the east, though more for the infamy of its owner, Greagan of the Low Hills. He was a bard, of sorts, though less for his love of people than his hatred of hard work. He bade a mage relation construct this harp so its magic might disguise his utter lack of talent in the arts. Its power was greater than he had hoped, and he later turned to petty burglary using 'his' music to captivate his victims. Greagan ultimately disappeared some years ago amidst rumors of a bardic college uncharacteristically moved to violence. The harp still functions, though any self-respecting troubadour would reserve its use for the most dire of circumstances.

At first, the soldiers were surprised that a jester was to accompany them on this task, merrily mocking his meager physique and his apparent fatuousness, but after they encountered the first Umber Hulk they soon realized the true importance of his role. To the soldiers' astonishment, the jester was completely unfazed by the Umber Hulk's terrible gaze, which simultaneously turned one of their most steadfast warriors into a stuporing idiot. Furthermore, the odd, quirky tune which the jester's harp produced somehow seemed to counter the effect of the monster's gaze, restoring the sanity to the afflicted soldier. In the end, the infestation was cleansed with no casualties and only minimal injuries. For the better part of their home trip, the soldiers carried the jester on their shoulders, all the time chanting praises in his honor.

It seems that the evil we once exiled from our homeland has come back to haunt us. Even though reports from Athkatla have been vague, we are now certain that the two are still hiding somewhere within the city. Despite their treacherous actions, the Council has forbidden us from directly interfering until their motives have been made clear. The General expressed his concern that the exiled ones will eventually attempt to seek revenge on us, but the Council is adamant in its decision.

...

Alturiak 21st, 1369
Tonight, the General has appointed a secret meeting with a few of his most trusted Scouts, myself included. We share his suspicions and have unanimously agreed that action must be taken. However, since we will be acting beyond the will of the Council, our actions will have to be carried out with extreme subtlety. For the safety of our people, as early as next week we shall break off to Atkhatla, in secret. It will be hard saying farewell to my beloved L'saria, not knowing when, or even if I shall return. But I am a soldier, and my duty is clear. I know she will understand.

I have arrived to the city yesterday, late at night, and I've quickly found an inn to my liking. It's quite cosy here, and they even hold theatrical plays from time to time. Nonetheless, in order to acquire the proof which the Council demands, the General has instructed me to mingle with the local thieves, as the exiled ones seem to have some kind of an arrangement with them. My Scout training should help me to easily blend in among them without drawing too much attention to myself.

Unfortunately, my rank within the guild is still fairly low so I was unable to gather much information, except for the fact that the Shadow Thieves have become much more cautious of accepting new members. Apparently, that is the result of their ongoing conflict with a newly formed rival guild. I suspect that the exiled ones are involved somehow and I have to investigate this further.

After Amaunator seemingly disappeared and the Keep of the Eternal Sun had fallen, the shield's brilliant golden finish began to fade and its powerful enchantments started to dissolve. Eventually, the once mighty artifact was degraded to a mere wall decoration. As time passed, Amaunator's followers slowly fell into disarray and started to disband. The shield was lastly pillaged from their temple along with many other relics.

His colleagues were not as talented as Celemon, and destroyed their laboratory and themselves when a mishap occurred.  The formula was destroyed as well.  This particular amulet was owned by the elven warrior-mage Pelan Rainwind.  It was lost when he was killed by giants in the Spine of the World somewhere around 840 DR.

After being caught twice, Elpham invested his money in having these boots made.  Of course, Elpham came to an untimely end when he picked the pocket of the notoriously ill-tempered Red Wizard of Thay, Xain Morobdel.  Elpham stole a pouch full of gems off of Xain's waist and danced off into the crowd shouting, "Why don't you try to chase me back to the Priador, baldy?  Ha ha!"  Xain, quietly fuming, promptly summoned four invisible stalkers and commanded them to, "Kill the idiot in the red and green boots."

@207 = ~This superbly crafted axe holds an enchantment of unusual origin. Immediately after it was forged the axe was brought on top of a high mountain peak where dwarven priests waited for a great storm to gather. The weapon was placed on an iron pedestal and was soon afterward struck by a bolt of lightning. Because of the pre-placed enchantment it absorbed some of the bolt's properties. The axe was later given to a high-ranking dwarven officer to aid him in the ensuing battle between the orcish hordes and the dwarves of Dorn's Deep. The attack came as a complete surprise to the dwarves when one morning a scout arrived and told that the largest orcish army he had ever seen was only hours away. With little time to prepare, the dwarven warriors were overrun and the orcs began to pour into Dorn's Deep. The dwarves were forced to retreat into the depths of the citadel but key passages were collapsed to cover their movements and buy them time. Even in such dire conditions, this allowed the dwarves to control when and where they would fight. Every battle cost the orcs dearly as the dwarves fought on their terms, but they were still being driven farther and farther back into Wyrm's Tooth Glacier. Eventually, due to their superior numbers, the orcs managed to breach the dwarven defenses and plunder their homes.

@216 = ~Silent Death~
@217 = ~This sword once belonged to Venduris, a cunning assassin in service of Cyric - the reigning God of Murder. When the rogue was initially accepted into the Order of Cyric's Chosen he received a small, plain-looking blade as a welcoming gift. Though the sword held only minor enchantments back then, its power and sharpness seemed to grow with each kill Venduris made in the name of his new master. The assassin preferred to fulfill these tasks swiftly and silently, so his victims were almost never aware of their nearing demise. However, on certain occasions when a foe had particularly angered the Prince of Lies, Venduris would apply a deadly venom to his blade before striking. The victim would then start choking, rendered unable to speak or cry for help, while Cyric laughed in glee as the mute face of his adversary twisted from the pain and agony caused by the subsequent poison effects, which eventually led to a slow, tormented death.

This sword pulsates with a dim, greenish glow and emanates a powerful evil aura. The tip and edges of the blade are extremely sharp and constantly coated with a layer of magical poison which makes it very difficult to use the sword without harming oneself. Only rogues of exceptional skill and cunning may attempt to wield this weapon.

@220 = ~The Salamander's Tongue~
@221 = ~A wicked-looking dagger with a dark history, the Salamander's Tongue is prized both for its use as a weapon and its hidden magical powers.  The blade appears to be an exotic-looking dagger with a kris-like wavy blade ending in two small points.  A small portion of a slimy, brightly red, living salamander's tongue is somehow embedded in the heart of the blade, near the grip.  It pulses and writhes randomly without intervention from the owner.  

The exact origins of the blade are unknown, but it is believed that the first owner of the weapon was a respected and feared gnomish thief and assassin from Westgate named Turlam Shallowhill.  Turlam was killed in a fight with a rival, a halfling called Deder Seven Fingers.  Deder kept the weapon as a trophy, not knowing its powers until after it was stolen by an underling, a fellow halfling named Kreshinal Blackhound.  Kreshinal fled to Selgaunt with the dagger for five years, relying on its powers to hide him from divination.  Kreshinal lost the dagger in a botched gambling scam, and was killed by Deder's agents within the month.  Deder attempted to reclaim the dagger from the Sembian criminals who had captured it.  He succeeded at routing the thieves and reclaiming his dagger, but he focused so much attention on the blade that he didn't notice that the Sembian criminals had employed a priest of Mask to infiltrate and break down his interests in Westgate.  The ensuing war between the Westgate and Selgaunt factions ended when the priest of Mask, Pieter the Feeble, made the two sides so paranoid that they ate themselves away from the inside.  Pieter grabbed the dagger when he had the opportunity and escaped to Hillsfar, confident that the unorganized demihuman supporters of the late Deder Seven Fingers wouldn't follow him to a place so hostile to their kind.

In yet another scam, Pieter sold the blade to a Mulmaster Hawk while luring other potential buyers to an auction in Hillsfar.  Pieter and his associates murdered the buyers at the fake auction and made off with the cash, hiding under the cover of an Amulet of Non-Detection.  The Mulmaster Hawk who purchased the blade was supposedly killed by priestesses of Umberlee who were angry at the assassin's refusal to pay tribute to the Bitch Queen.  Years of factional fighting between the Umberlants are believed to have transported the blade as much as three thousand miles away from its humble beginnings in Sembia.  The whereabouts of Pieter the Feeble and his goons are currently unknown.

@223 = ~These ancient helms were once common among the Reghedmen barbarians who came to what is now known as Icewind Dale.  The design of the armor is relatively simple: a plain iron helm with a hinged faceplate.  Once the basic construction of the helm had been finished, craftsmen would tool the image of a dead warrior onto the faceplate.  The name of the warrior and a one-word description of his death were carved into the forehead of the mask.  The helm was then left in the dead warrior's funeral pyre.  The priests believed that the mask would hide the dead man's fear of the afterlife when he was judged by Tempos.  After a month had passed, the helms of particularly valiant warriors were recovered by the priests.  Over the next few years, the priests praised the valiant warriors by name in their daily rituals.  According to legend, if Tempos found the warrior to be truly valiant, the helm would gain the power to make the wearer immune to fear.  This particular helm bears the ancient name "Siglef" and the word "Axe".

It is typically fashioned only into tunics, as drow elves share their forest-bound cousins' preference for armor that adequately protects without being overly weighty or restrictive. The exceptional lightness of this armor allows it to be worn by thieves and fighter/mages with few restrictions. Furthermore, drow chain mail grants a small bonus to magic resistance and slightly reduces the casting time of all spells while worn.

Unlike most drow equipment, this particular drow chain mail was not crafted using Adamantine since it was designed for scouts who regularly travel to the surface. Therefore, it will not decay when exposed to direct sunlight but it doesn't provide as much protection as regular drow armor.

The great tree draws into itself all the ebb and flow of seasons and lives within the woodlands of the green elves. At the same time, it defends and sustains those lands against disease, predation, and assaults of all kinds. On special occasions, Rillifane's high priests show their respect to The Leaflord by weaving oaken leaves into the shape of laurel crowns which are subsequently blessed and treated with protective enchantments. These ceremonial crowns rarely leave the elven lands, mainly because their magic is closely attuned to the very souls of the Fair Folk. Only a renegade or an exile would dare to take such a sacred item out of the elven community.

Shortly after defeating Bodhi and retrieving the Rhynn Lanthorn, I was ambushed by a mysterious party of rogues while trying to exit the city. I didn't get a chance to talk to them much, but their leader managed to trap me within some sort of magical barrier, hoping that it would help him defeat me.~

@601 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen

Shortly after defeating Bodhi and retrieving the Rhynn Lanthorn, I was ambushed by a mysterious party of rogues while trying to exit the city. They claimed to belong to the Chosen of Cyric, a fanatical order whose members firmly believes in Cyric's superiority and work to sow discord and bring about his ascension to power over the other faiths. Apparently, they wanted to end my life in order to please their patron deity and prevent me from fulfilling the prophecies of Alaundo. Their leader, the assassin Venduris, managed to trap me within some sort of magical barrier, hoping that it would help him defeat me.~

@602 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: The Warding Glyphs

Venduris carelessly told me that he is in direct control of the wards which are trapping me here. This seemed quite strange to me since he obviously had no arcane training and didn't use the usual somatic gestures of a spellcaster when he invoked the spell. I strongly suspect that someone else had set up the warding glyphs for him and that he was merely controlling them by using either a vital spell component or a command scroll with the inscribed incantations.~

@610 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: Victory...?

I have bested Venduris and his group in combat, but the way out still seems to be blocked by strange wards which defy normal dispelling methods. I must find some other way of nullifying them if I am to ever leave this place. Perhaps investigating Venduris' belongings will provide some clues.~

@611 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: The Slayer's fury

As I expected, the cowardly rogue and his petty band tried to flee after I showed them the true extent of the Slayer's power. However, I was too infuriated to let them get away so easily. I lunged towards the leader and tore his head off in delight before he could even react, as the rest of his company helplessly watched and screamed in terror. Unfortunately, I was unable to hold the avatar form much longer as the released energies began to toil heavily at my body. No matter, I can take the remaining fools even without the aid of my infernal heritage!~

@620 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: The scroll backfired!

I have found an arcane scroll in Venduris' pack. It was inscribed with many runes and symbols which clearly resembled the design of the wards that were blocking my path. Since I had no skill to interpret them, I decided to simply destroy the scroll and hope for the best. Luckily, it worked, and the warding glyphs were dispelled, though the magical backslash from the released energy nearly killed me.~

@621 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: The wards are defeated

I have found an arcane scroll in Venduris' pack. It was inscribed with many runes and symbols which clearly resembled the design of the wards that were blocking my path.

@622 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: The right of might

I was able to convince Venduris and his followers that engaging in battle would be equally hazardous for us all. As he realized that my power could easily match that of his own, the cowardly rogue decided to flee and reconsider his approach. No matter, should the pathetic weakling dare to harass me again, I am more than confident that I shall prevail once more.~

I was able to convince Venduris and his followers that engaging in battle with me would be counterproductive to their cause. As he realized that he lacked the necessary information to dispute my claims, the rogue and his companions left, threatening to return and attack me anew should my arguments prove lacking.~

@624 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: The power of persuasion

I was able to convince Venduris and his followers that engaging in battle with me was completely unnecessary. As he realized that I am a force of Good and have no reason or desire to betray my beliefs, the rogue and his companions left, warning me that there are others of my kin might who are not as kindhearted.~

@630 = ~Ambushed by Cyric's Chosen: The Slayer unleashed!

As I expected, the cowardly rogue and his petty band have fled after I demonstrated the power of the Slayer. Ha! Those foolish half-wits thought they knew everything about me, but they quickly realized the true degree of their ignorance after witnessing a display of my infernal fury. Should those pathetic weaklings dare to harass me once more, I may not be so forgiving to let them leave unscathed again!~

@650 = ~A missing fence?

Aran informed me that Gaelan Bayle, the agent who referred me to him, has reported one of his fences as missing. It is possible that this man has joined the rival guild and I am to visit Gaelan and inquire about the matter when I get the chance.~

@651 = ~A missing fence?

Gaelan informed me that Arledrian, one of his fences, has disappeared a few nights ago. He said I could search Arledrian's room for any clues. I should be wary of traps as the elf appears to be slightly paranoid about his belongings.~

@652 = ~A missing fence?

While searching Arledrian's room I have discovered a pamphlet which is advertising the theater plays that are held under the Five Flagons inn. I could inform Gaelan about this or I could go directly to the inn and look for Arledrian there.~

@653 = ~A missing fence?

I've shown the pamphlet that I found in Arledrian's room to Gaelan, who now thinks that his missing fence may have joined the rival guild. I am to visit the Five Flagons inn and question the barkeeper about Arledrian's whereabouts.~

@654 = ~A missing fence?

The barkeeper of the Five Flagons inn has given me permission to search a room which Arledrian had recently rented. Perhaps I'll find more clues there. His room is the first one to the left on the upper floor of the inn.~

@660 = ~A missing fence?

I have found Arledrian's journal, but it was written in Elvish and I lack the necessary knowledge and skills to decipher it. Perhaps Gaelan Bayle knows of someone who could assist me.~

@661 = ~A missing fence?

I've found Arledrian's journal, but it was written in Elvish and I lack the necessary knowledge and skills to decipher it. I'll have to find someone else who can translate it for me.~

@662 = ~A missing fence?

I have read Arledrian's journal. From the looks of it, he was heading toward the Graveyard district searching for vampires.~

@663 = ~A missing fence?

Gaelan instructed me to bring Arledrian's journal to Marina, a Shadow Thief fence who usually sells her wares on the ground floor of the guildhall. Apparently, she too is of elven descent and so she should be able to translate the recent entries.~

@664 = ~A missing fence?

Apparently, Arledrian died while fighting some vampires and I have found his body. Perhaps Gaelan Bayle would like to know about this.~

@665 = ~A missing fence?

I have tricked Arledrian into imbibing a potion which incinerated him from the inside. He is dead, and his money and gear are now mine for the taking. Perhaps it would be wise not to tell Gaelan the truth about this "incident".~

@666 = ~A missing fence?

After skimming through the most recent entries of Arledrian's Journal, Marina pointed me to the crypts under the Graveyard district. Apparently, Arledrian was last headed there.~

@670 = ~A missing fence?

I have informed Gaelan of Arledrian's true allegiance and his recent activities. The rogue rewarded me for my efforts upon receiving the news.~

@671 = ~A missing fence?

I have informed Gaelan of Arledrian's recent activities but not of his true allegiance. The rogue rewarded me for my efforts upon receiving the news.~

@672 = ~A missing fence?

I have informed Gaelan of Arledrian's demise. The rogue rewarded me for my efforts upon receiving the news.~

@673 = ~A missing fence?

I have informed Gaelan of Arledrian's fate. The rogue was not pleased that I didn't bring him in for questioning and I received no reward for my efforts.~

@680 = ~Selune's light protect me!~
@681 = ~I may be outmatched, but I shall not be defeated!~

@721 = ~Control Rod~
@722 = ~When Haz began crafting the first batch of defense golems which were commissioned by the local Cloakmaster, several of his fellow Shadow Thieves insisted that the mage should provide a foolproof way to deactivate the powerful constructs, should the need arise. Haz initially dismissed these concerns as unfounded, but after several high-ranking guild members began to express their doubts and openly question Haz's motives, the mage finally gave in and fashioned several Control Rods which were then given to the most vocal disbelievers. In effect, anyone who wields one of these items is able to deactivate any golem of Haz's making by merely holding up the Control Rod and walking into the construct's field of view. Naturally, it is impossible to deactivate a golem while it is in the immediate vicinity of its maker. Furthermore, the inscription on the rod's shaft specifically warns against attacking deactivated golems as doing so will make them resume their standard combat routine.

STATISTICS:

Equipped Abilities:
  Any golem crafted by Haz will automatically deactivate in the presence of the rod's wielder. In order for this ability to take effect, the rod must be prominently equipped and its wielder must approach the golem alone. Once deactivated, a golem will remain dormant forevermore, unless it is attacked. This rod will have no effect on golems that were not crafted by Haz.

@725 = ~\[Lore\] - As you might know, there is much more to the Shadow Thieves than meets the eye, no organized crime in the city goes without their influence and approval. It is rumored that they may have even infiltrated the Council of Six by now. Face it, you will need every ally you can get if you truly seek to overthrow them.~
@726 = ~\[Intelligence\] - Hold on, think of the advantage that you could gain from my employment. The Shadow Thieves are highly resourceful and exceptionally skilled adversaries. Having an ally by your side who possesses similar traits would make dealing with them considerably easier.~
@727 = ~\[Wisdom\] - Would it be so unreasonable to have one of their ilk work for you? After all, as a thief I am quite familiar with their strengths and weaknesses as well as their mindset. Surely you must realize that such insight could prove very useful under the right circumstances.~
@728 = ~\[Charisma\] - My involvement with the Shadow Thieves is of a temporary nature. Trust me, I would have no qualms about betraying them should your offer suit me better.~

@735 = ~Hmm, you have chosen your words cunningly and by that I am... intrigued. Very well then, I shall give you a chance to prove your worth.~


@750 = ~Wha--!!? Where did *you* come from?~

@752 = ~Excellent, I have some valuable information that the Mistress needs to hear. Cast the spell then, whenever you're ready.~
@753 = ~Alright, I'll leave that to you then. Be careful though, I've heard that the Shadow Thieves recently started hiring mercenaries, as their own ranks began to grow thin due to the guild war.~
@754 = ~Thank you! I'll slip out quietly before the guards notice that my cell is empty.~
@755 = ~Has there been a change of plans?~
@756 = ~Thank you! I will report to the Mistress immediately.~

@760 = ~Shhh, the guards are still out there! However, you could sneak out with relative ease if an invisibility spell was cast on you. I'll see what I can do about that.~
@761 = ~Stay put for now, I'll come back after I've dealt with the guards.~
@762 = ~The guards have been dealt with and the way out is clear. It's safe for you to leave now.~

// Marina's dialogue and Arledrian's Quest (1000-1499)

@1000 = ~Your selection seems pretty mediocre. Don't you have some more potent equipment?~
@1001 = ~\[Thieves' Cant\] - Surely you have some more useful equipment for a fellow rogue?~
@1002 = ~Gaelan sent me, I need your help with this journal. It's written in elvish and I can't decipher it.~
@1003 = ~\[Thieves' Cant\] - Hello Marina. Can I see your special stock again?~
@1004 = ~Excuse me... but do you happen to have a sister, or another close relative who practices the arcane arts?  I've recently met a sorceress who looked very much like you.~
@1005 = ~I have found Arledrian.~
@1006 = ~I most certainly do, but you will have to pay a small... 'insurance fee' of 50 gold pieces first. (she smiles)  'Acquiring' items of great power is a risky business, you know.~
@1007 = ~Hmm...   (she studies you quizzically for a moment)~
@1008 = ~Well, you seem to be alright.~
@1009 = ~But of course, friend.  (She smiles pleasantly, awaiting your purchase with interest)~
@1010 = ~(Marina's usually cheerful demeanor fades away at the sound of your words. Her face becomes serious and slightly troubled.)~
@1011 = ~I- I do actually. My younger sister...Selina, she practices the art...or at least, she still was, the last time I saw her.~
@1012 = ~Here...take a look at this, <GABBER>. Was that the woman you saw?~
@1013 = ~(Marina takes off her golden locket and opens up the medallion, revealing a picture of her and Selina. You are now certain that the woman you saw was indeed her sister.)~
@1014 = ~Have you spoken to her? Is she...alright? Please, you must tell me! (her face becomes filled with desperation)~
@1015 = ~Yes, I believe that I have met her near the City Gates a while ago. She seemed to belong to a company of Cyric's followers who wanted to kill me, but I have convinced them that it was not worth the risk. She then left, along with the others.~
@1016 = ~I'm sorry Marina, your sister is dead. I have killed her, but it was in self defense. She seemed to belong to a company of Cyric's followers and assaulted me. I had no choice.~
@1017 = ~Actually, your sister is dead, and I've enjoyed gutting her.~
@1018 = ~\[Lie\] - No, I must have mistaken her for someone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Farewell.~
@1019 = ~What!? Followers of... Cyric? (She pauses as if suddenly remembering something)~
@1020 = ~Venduris...~
@1021 = ~After all that malicious cutthroat did to us... my deluded sister still trusts him so blindly?  (she lowers her head)  I must go and seek her out at once.~
@1022 = ~(Marina hastily gathers her belongings and prepares to leave. Before heading through the door she turns to you once more.)~
@1023 = ~Thank you <GABBER>, I will not forget this, and I hope you won't forget me so soon either. Catch!~
@1024 = ~(She smiles at you and tosses you a brilliant, rainbow-patterned gem before dashing out through the door)~
@1025 = ~What!? (She cringes) You... you fiend!~
@1026 = ~Selina... my dear sister...  (Marina is visibly shaken, barely holding back her tears)~
@1027 = ~(After a moment, she manages to gather her composure. She then slowly pulls out a scroll from her vest and looks straight at you with eyes full of hatred.)~
@1028 = ~Murderer! I will NEVER forget this, <GABBER>!~
@1029 = ~(At the sound of your words Marina's face stiffens. She grows pale and is obviously deeply stricken with grief.)~
@1030 = ~(After a moment, she manages to gather her composure.)~
@1031 = ~You...~
@1032 = ~(She looks toward you, barely holding back the tears in her eyes.)~
@1033 = ~You did... what you had to do.~
@1034 = ~My sister chose the path of evil for herself. It was her fault for following that... monster...~
@1035 = ~...and it was my fault for not preventing it.~
@1036 = ~(Her head bowed, Marina looks toward the exit.)~
@1037 = ~Thank you... for having the decency to inform me, but now I must be going.~
@1038 = ~I will make sure that my sister gets a proper burial, before some of those Cyric fanatics get to her body.~
@1039 = ~Goodbye, <GABBER>.~
@1040 = ~Well now, Gaelan sent you to little old me? Hmm, I take it this is important.~
@1041 = ~What do you need my help with?~
@1042 = ~I'm currently investigating the disappearance of one of his fences. I found this journal and was hoping it might shed some light on the subject. Here, take a look. (give Arledrian's journal)~
@1043 = ~(Marina quickly glances over the journal.)~
@1044 = ~Hmm, Arledrian is the one who's missing? Ha, I know that uptight scoundrel, and I always thought he had something to hide. Let's see...~
@1045 = ~(Marina quickly scans through the entries of the last months.)~
@1046 = ~Now that's interesting, he really had a... Oh!~
@1047 = ~Oh my! (she suddenly looks worried)~
@1048 = ~What? What is it? Did you find anything!?~
@1049 = ~(Marina's face turns pale after reading through the last journal entry)~
@1050 = ~That poor bastard, he was sent to his death!~
@1051 = ~<CHARNAME>, Arledrian went to the Graveyard district hoping to discover some information about the new guild but... he will surely perish in the attempt!~
@1052 = ~You must rush to his aid, or he might not make it back alive!~
@1053 = ~'Sent to his death?' Was Arledrian working for someone?~
@1054 = ~What do you suggest I do, track him down?~
@1055 = ~No time to explain now! Here, take his journal back.~
@1056 = ~Look for Arledrian in Graveyard district, I think he was headed to the underground levels. Please hurry, I have a bad feeling about this...~
@1057 = ~Alright, I'll head out immediately.~
@1058 = ~Yeah, sure. One elf less, so what? I'll be there in my own time.~
@1059 = ~Really?~
@1060 = ~Is he... is he alright?~
@1061 = ~Yes he is fine. I've helped him fend off some vampires.~
@1062 = ~No, he is dead.~
@1063 = ~That was very noble of you <CHARNAME>. You have my gratitude.~
@1064 = ~You bring me sad news <CHARNAME>, but I suppose you did all you could. Thank you for informing me of his death.~
@1090 = ~Hands off. Now.~
@1091 = ~Try that again and you'll pull back a stump.~
@1092 = ~I warned you!~



@1100 = ~\[Insight\] - (Take a closer look at the finely decorated silver dagger strapped to Arledrian's belt.)~
@1101 = ~(The dagger slowly pulses with a faint blue glow. Powerful elven runes are inscribed along both edges of the silvery blade.)~
@1102 = ~(This weapon appears to be of great importance to Arledrian. Ever so often he readjusts the dagger's grip, making sure it is securely fastened to his belt.)~
@1103 = ~(Even a master pickpocket would find great difficulty in an attempt to steal the blade.)~
@1104 = ~That is a marvelously crafted dagger, may I ask where you have acquired it? I would like to purchase such a powerful weapon myself.~
@1105 = ~\[Insight\] - Hmm, trying to steal that dagger would be too difficult right now. I better not make the attempt until I further improve my skills.~
@1106 = ~\[Pickpocket\] - Divert Arledrian's attention to other matters and attempt to carefully snatch the dagger.~
@1107 = ~(Although you managed to convince Arledrian that you were not trying to steal his dagger previously, he is now paying much more attention to the blade while you are around.)~
@1108 = ~\[Insight\] - Hmm, Arledrian is already suspicious of me, and trying to steal the dagger again would be too risky right now. I better not make the attempt until my skills have improved.~
@1109 = ~(Arledrian's attention turns to the blade. He tightly grips the hilt of the dagger, making sure it is secured.)~
@1110 = ~It was... a gift.~
@1111 = ~(He gazes at you somewhat suspiciously.)~
@1112 = ~And it is *not* for sale!~
@1113 = ~Alright then, show me the items that *are* for sale.~
@1114 = ~Well that's too bad. I will be going then, farewell.~
@1115 = ~(You have successfully occupied Arledrian's attention with trivial trading activities.)~
@1116 = ~(With a casual-looking move you carefully detach the dagger from the scabbard and hide it behind your palm.)~
@1117 = ~(While Arledrian is still busy presenting his wares to you, you manage to calmly secure the dagger inside your backpack. He didn't notice a thing!)~
@1118 = ~So, my <LADYLORD> what will it be then?~
@1119 = ~Actually, I think I have all I need from you right now, Arledrian. Farewell.~
@1120 = ~(You have successfully distracted Arledrian's attention with trivial shopping matters.)~
@1121 = ~(While attempting to carefully detach the dagger from the scabbard and hide it behind your palm your hand slips, and the hilt of the dagger brushes against Arledrian's arm.)~
@1122 = ~(Unfortunately, Arledrian has noticed your clumsily disguised pickpocket attempt and has taken the dagger away from you.)~
@1123 = ~What in Selune's name do you think you are doing?~
@1124 = ~\[Thieves' Cant\/Bluff\] - Come now Arledrian, I was merely testing your reflexes. We are both rogues, and you are certainly a better pickpocket, so I won't be trying that again.~
@1125 = ~Relax, I was just practicing my skills.~
@1126 = ~Hmm... (he takes a moment to ponder the situation)~
@1127 = ~Alright, I will believe you... this time.~
@1128 = ~But if I ever catch you trying to steal from me again you are through with the Shadow Thieves.~
@1129 = ~Is that clear, *my <LADYLORD>*?~
@1130 = ~I understand, and I apologize once again. Farewell, Arledrian. ~
@1131 = ~\[Lie\] - It certainly is, but I really have to be going now.~
@1132 = ~Oh really... is that so?~
@1133 = ~(He looks at you with a clear expression of distrust)~
@1134 = ~And you would have given the dagger back, had I not noticed the attempt... right?~
@1135 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. But that is no longer relevant since you've caught me anyway.~
@1136 = ~\[Lie\] - Yes, of course I would have done that!~
@1137 = ~Hmph, you think you are very clever, don't you?~
@1138 = ~Well, in that case perhaps I should report this 'incident' to the Shadow Thieves?~
@1139 = ~Somehow, I don't think my superiors would appreciate you trying to rob one of their best fences.~
@1140 = ~(You notice a gleam of trickery in his eyes)~
@1141 = ~But then again, I could be persuaded otherwise, *if* you properly reimburse me for the hmm, 'stress' that I've suffered in this little ordeal.~
@1142 = ~Shall we say... 500 gold pieces?~
@1143 = ~Alright, here you go. Can we now forget the whole deal?~
@1144 = ~\[Truth\] - But I don't have that much gold!~
@1145 = ~\[Lie\] - But I don't have that much gold!~
@1146 = ~Fine with me. But *don't* try to pull that off again!  (he smirks at you and takes the gold)~
@1147 = ~Alright, then I'll take whatever you have. Let's see...~
@1148 = ~(With a sudden, swift motion Arledrian cuts one of the gold pouches from your belt)~
@1149 = ~There, now we are even.  (he smirks at you and takes the gold)~
@1150 = ~(Arledrian's voice is growing weaker, and he seems to be straining with his every breath.)~
@1151 = ~Right... I should have thought that much... ~
@1152 = ~So, h-how did...  *cough* ...how did you... (His wounds look severe, and he is barely managing to maintain his composure.)~
@1153 = ~\[Lay On Hands\] - Easy there, don't strain yourself. Here, I can heal you by channeling some of my power into your body.~
@1154 = ~Easy there, don't strain yourself. Here, I can heal you with my magic.~
@1155 = ~Easy there, don't strain yourself. Here, take this healing potion, it will make you feel better. (give potion of healing)~
@1156 = ~Easy there, don't strain yourself. Here, drink this healing potion, it will make you feel better. (give potion of extra healing)~
@1157 = ~\[Lie\] - Hmm, you look pretty weak. Here, drink this... "healing potion", it will make you feel nice and warm. (give potion of explosions)~
@1158 = ~\[Lie\] - Hmm, you look pretty weak. Here, rub this... "healing salve" into your wounds, it will sear... err, seal your wounds shut. (give oil of fiery burning)~
@1159 = ~I wish I had something to ease your pain, but alas, I don't. I could take you to a healer if you'd like.~
@1160 = ~(Half-blinded by the dripping blood and stunned from the pain, the rogue prepares to gulp down the potion, not having the strength to check its contents.)~
@1161 = ~(Half-blinded by the dripping blood and stunned from the pain, the rogue prepares to use the oil flask, not having the strength to check its contents.)~
@1162 = ~(The rogue gratefully gulps down the potion and his face begins to brighten again.)  Thank you again, I feel much better now.~
@1163 = ~I was traveling light, hoping I wouldn't get noticed, but those things appeared out of thin air and ambushed me.~
@1164 = ~I dropped some of my potions during the battle and used the rest. Had you not come this way I would have surely perished.  (He gives you a brief, friendly smile.)~
@1165 = ~So tell me, how ever did you find me here?~
@1166 = ~I have found your journal, and the last entries pointed this way.~
@1167 = ~I was merely exploring the area.~
@1168 = ~Your... your words are kind, but I fear it is... too late for me now. Selune... guide my sou-~
@1169 = ~(Arledrian collapses from the pain and his eyes become vacant. His face gains a look of unnatural stillness.)~
@1170 = ~(He is dead.)~
@1171 = ~(As the curative magic starts to work Arledrian's face begins to brighten again.)~
@1172 = ~Thank you my friend. I feel much better now.~
@1173 = ~I have found your journal, and your last entries pointed this way.~
@1174 = ~(A sign of concern crosses Arledrian's face.)  You have read *my* journal!?~
@1175 = ~I am sorry, it was the only way to find you. Here, take it back.~
@1176 = ~Yeah, and that's how I found you, you ungrateful prick. Here, if it means that much to you, take your precious journal back.~
@1177 = ~I am sorry, it was the only way to find you.~
@1178 = ~Yeah, and that's how I found you, you ungrateful prick.~
@1179 = ~Actually no, I couldn't decipher it myself, but Marina read it and she pointed me this way. Here, you can have it back.~
@1180 = ~Actually no, I couldn't decipher it myself, but Marina read it and she pointed me this way.~
@1181 = ~(A sign of relief crosses Arledrian's face.)  Hmm, so you are not aware of...~
@1182 = ~Nevermind. I thank you for your assistance, <CHARNAME>.~
@1183 = ~Tell Gaelan that I have some personal matters to attend to. I will return to the guild when I am able to.~
@1184 = ~Until then, I bid you farewell.~
@1185 = ~I see...~
@1186 = ~So you know, don't you?~
@1187 = ~\[Insight\] - That you are an agent of the Suldanessellar War Council? Yes, that much is clear to me, but who are those "exiled ones" you keep mentioning?~
@1188 = ~\[Intimidate\] - Yes, your little scam is up. Hmm, I think Gaelan and the Shadowmaster would be very anxious to learn where your *true* allegiances lie.~
@1189 = ~I...~
@1190 = ~I'm sorry, but I can say no more. My superiors demand that I keep this matter discreet, until the right time has come.~
@1191 = ~But tell me, do you plan on standing up to this menace, do you intend to face those monsters on your own?~
@1192 = ~I do. Aran has sent me to clear out their lair.~
@1193 = ~Perhaps, but not at the moment.~
@1194 = ~(A look of desperation forms on the elf's face)~
@1195 = ~Please <CHARNAME>... my mission is of utmost importance! It must not be compromised, under any circumstances.~
@1196 = ~Sure... now, what is my silence worth to you?~
@1197 = ~Alright then, I'll keep this to myself. But why all the secrecy?~
@1198 = ~I... I will give you everything I have.~
@1199 = ~Here, you can take all of my equipment and gold. Just don't tell anyone about my task.~
@1200 = ~Very good. Have no fear, no one will hear a word from me about your mission. I shall tell Gaelan that you simply left the city.~
@1201 = ~\[Lie\] - That's more like it. Now relax, no one will hear a word from me about your mission. I shall tell Gaelan that you simply left the city.~
@1202 = ~I hope you keep your word <CHARNAME>, there is much more at stake here than you know.~
@1203 = ~In that case, you will need this more than I do.~
@1204 = ~(Arledrian shows you a finely enchanted dagger.)~
@1205 = ~It was a gift from my beloved L'saria, but I'm sure she wouldn't mind you having the blade. After all, I owe you my life.~
@1206 = ~(The rogue shakes your hand, showing you a friendly smile. After letting go, you notice that he left the dagger resting on your palm.)~
@1207 = ~Farewell <CHARNAME>, and may Selune's light illuminate your path!~
@1208 = ~In that case, you should be very careful. Don't trust a word those fiends tell you, especially not their mistress.~

@1213 = ~(Arledrian's face is filled with contempt)~
@1214 = ~So, my elvish *<PRO_BROTHERSISTER>*, you have abused the trust of the Shadow Thieves and consorted with Bodhi and her spawns of darkness instead? You are no better than the exiled ones!~
@1215 = ~(Arledrian almost considers fighting you but after a brief moment he calms himself again)~
@1216 = ~But I shall not sink to your level, <CHARNAME>. No matter the circumstances, I could never break the sacred traditions of our people and fight against another of elven blood.~

@1220 = ~You... you could have helped me...  *cough* I was struggling for my life there!~
@1221 = ~Yet you chose to merely observe my suffering... What are your intentions, <CHARNAME>!?~
@1222 = ~\[Bluff\] - I wouldn't have been much help anyway, those vampires were too strong for me.~
@1223 = ~I was sent to find you, not to fight your battles.~
@1224 = ~(Shaken by the battle, the wounded elven rogue takes a moment to catch his breath and then throws you a surprised look.)~
@1225 = ~Th-Thank you for your help <CHARNAME>, I fear... I wouldn't have lasted much longer against those vile creatures. *cough* But tell me, friend, what in Selune's name were you doing down here?~
@1226 = ~You are welcome Arledrian. I was sent here by Gaelan, he was worried about your sudden disappearance.~
@1227 = ~The Shadow Thieves asked me to look for you. One thing led to the other.~

@1305 = ~Nothing so far. I'll let you know when I learn more.~
@1306 = ~Best ye let me see that. Hm, this be lookin' like one of those things they're handin' out at the Five Flagons. Should 'ave figured he was hangin' 'round there, him having always blabberin' 'bout "lack of culture" in this downrotten town of ours.~
@1307 = ~Ye'd best pay a visit to that establishment an' pester the innkeep for what he be knowin'.~
@1308 = ~Alright. I'll let you know if I find out anything new.~
@1309 = ~No promises. I'll do it if I get the chance.~
@1310 = ~Hm, figures he'd be writin' it in his own tongue.~
@1311 = ~Well, I might be knowin' a girl in the guild who could help ye out with that. Her name be Marina, and she usually peddles 'er wares inside the guildhall.~
@1312 = ~Ye just go see her and tell 'er I send ye. She may not look like it, but that lass has elven blood runnin' through her veins. With luck, she migh' just be able to translate somethin' useful out of it.~
@1313 = ~And, I reckon it be an interesting read? Have ye found some leads?~
@1314 = ~(hide Arledrian's true identity) - Just a few loose hints. It appears that he's been skulking around the Graveyard district. Probably looking for treasure.~
@1315 = ~(reveal Arledrian's true identity) - According to this he was an agent of the Suldanessellar War Council and he had infiltrated your organization in order to learn more about your rival guild.~
@1316 = ~Ye sure? I never would've figured that scrowny elf was a tomb raider!~
@1317 = ~If ye happen to run into him, tell Arledrian to report to the Shadowmaster at once.~
@1318 = ~No problem. I'll inform him if I see him.~
@1319 = ~Very well, but don't count on me to waste my time searching for him.~
@1320 = ~That so? Man, that elf sure got me fooled and fooled good!~
@1321 = ~The Shadowmaster won't be likin' this at all. Best ye let me bring him these hapless news personally.~
@1322 = ~Here, take this for yer trouble. An' if ye happen to find that bastard Arledrian, do be bringin' him here.~
@1323 = ~I fancy Aran has plenty o' things to ask him.~
@1324 = ~Coo, ye be here again! Has the Shadowmaster sent ye this way, per chance?~
@1325 = ~As a matter of fact he did. Aran told me that you are missing one of your fences?~
@1326 = ~Yes, but I haven't got much time so be quick about it. Now what is this about a missing fence?~
@1327 = ~Well now, have ye met with Arledrian upstairs? Tall an' skinny fellow. Long hair, pointy ears, green chain shirt.~
@1328 = ~That elven shopkeeper? Yes I've had some deals with him. Is he the one who has disappeared?~
@1329 = ~No, not really. Is he the fence you are missing?~
@1330 = ~Aye, and that be mighty strange too. Arledrian's always been the trustworthy kind, ne'er botched a deal since I've hired him.~
@1331 = ~Not like him to just disappear without a word. I reckon somethin's a foul here.~
@1332 = ~\[Insight\] - Have you tried searching his room? Perhaps we could find some clues about your fence's disappearance by looking through his personal belongings.~
@1333 = ~Aran thinks he might have crossed over and joined the rival guild.~
@1334 = ~Have you noticed anything strange about him lately?~
@1335 = ~Any ideas where he might have gone?~
@1336 = ~Him? Nah, I don't think so, but who knows. Those elves be a chaotic bunch alright.~
@1337 = ~Right. I'll be on my way then, if I find anything new I'll let you know.~
@1338 = ~Hm, now that ye mention it, Arledrian's always been a wee bit paranoid. Not only does he be lockin' away his stuff, lately he's been riggin' the lockers with magical snares as well!~
@1339 = ~He used to lend me some of those fancy books of his before, but a few months ago he even entrapped that damn bookcase! A bookcase I tell ye!~
@1340 = ~Well, he always preferred hangin' 'round taverns than staying within the guildhall. Said the stale basement air gave him headaches, he did.~
@1341 = ~Who knows, maybe he just got drunk and overslept a night or two, but as far as I be knowin', that ain't really somethin' he'd do.~
@1342 = ~Are ye mad? I ain't going up there. The whole place is full of his stinkin' traps, ye hear!~
@1343 = ~Ye be free to risk yer own neck however, just inform me if ye find anything.~
@1344 = ~Alright, I'll go take a look upstairs then, since you don't mind.~
@1345 = ~Really now? Well, well... tell me then, <CHARNAME>, where be our long lost friend a hidin'?~
@1346 = ~Not too well, he is dead.~
@1347 = ~Alive and well, but he won't be coming back so soon. He is an agent of the Suldanessellar War Council. (reveal Arledrian's secret to Gaelan...)~
@1348 = ~He is fine. As you know, he is an agent of the Suldanessellar War Council and he went to report home.~
@1349 = ~Alredrian won't be coming back so soon. He asked me to tell you that he had to leave the city for personal reasons.~
@1350 = ~Well, in any case, I thank ye for your help <CHARNAME>. Here, take this and know that the Shadow Thieves treat their allies well. (he hands you a small bag full of gems)~
@1351 = ~Personal reasons? That damned elf, he's got some nerve!~
@1352 = ~Bah, an' he'd been one of my best fences, ya know. We'd have made a load of gold, we would.~
@1353 = ~Anyway, I thank ye for yer help <CHARNAME>. Take this and know that the Shadow Thieves treat their allies well. (he hands you a small bag full of gems)~
@1354 = ~An' I be tellin ye to bring him 'ere! I damn well wanted to question him for meself!~
@1355 = ~Bah, get ye out of my sight <CHARNAME>!~
@1356 = ~Oh? And jus' how did that happen?~
@1357 = ~\[Truth\] - I killed him. As you know, he was an agent of the Suldanessellar War Council, and he opposed me as well as the Shadow Thieves.~
@1358 = ~\[Truth\] - I killed him. He was an agent of the Suldanessellar War Council and he opposed me as well as the Shadow Thieves. (reveal Arledrian's secret to Gaelan...)~
@1359 = ~\[Truth\] - I tricked and killed him. He got what he deserved for being so gullible.~
@1360 = ~\[Truth\] - He perished while fighting some vampires.~
@1361 = ~\[Lie\/Bluff\] - He perished while fighting some vampires.~
@1362 = ~Ye *killed* 'im? In cold blood, jus' like that, no provocation?~
@1363 = ~(Gaelan seems genuinely surprised by your words)~
@1364 = ~Vampires ye say? Hmm, so he hadn't joined our foes after all. At least, we be knowin' his fate now.~
@1365 = ~Bah, ever since that bastard Arledrian's left I've been stuck with peddlin' the wares meself. So, err, are ye interested in buying somethin' <GABBER>?~



// Partymember interjections for Marina's dialogue and Arledrian's quest

@1500 = ~And he would be right, my good Samuel. The plays here are truly exquisite, even if I do say so myself.~
@1501 = ~Somehow, I do not think that will present a problem. And while we're at it, we could "search" the other rooms as well, just to make sure we don't miss anything.~
@1502 = ~Mind your manners, rogue!~
@1503 = ~Pray tell, my raven, does that riddle puzzle you greatly?~
@1504 = ~Mayhaps I can be of assistance. During my travels I have picked up bits and pieces of many languages, elvish being one of my favorites.~
@1505 = ~(Haer'Dalis quickly pages through the recent entries, scribbling some notes on the side)~
@1506 = ~Hmm... what an unexpected turn of events! As it seems, this tale has only just begun to truly unfold.~
@1507 = ~I have fashioned you a fairly accurate translation of the last few pages <CHARNAME>. An interesting read, to say the least.~
@1508 = ~May I be of assistance, <CHARNAME>? As a druid I am somewhat familiar with the sylvian alphabet and the elven tongue.~
@1509 = ~(Cernd quickly pages through the recent entries, scribbling some notes on the side)~
@1510 = ~Interesting, there seems to be more to that rogue than meets the eye.~
@1511 = ~See for yourself <CHARNAME>, I have translated the last couple of pages.~
@1512 = ~Allow me <CHARNAME>. Even though its very sound sickens me, I'm quite familiar with the language of the darthiir.~
@1513 = ~(Viconia quickly pages through the recent entries, scribbling some notes on the side)~
@1514 = ~My, my how... intriguing. Here <CHARNAME>, I have translated the most important passages for you. You should be able to understand the context now.~
@1515 = ~Umm... I could help you with that, <CHARNAME>.~
@1516 = ~(Aerie quickly pages through the recent entries, scribbling some notes on the side)~
@1517 = ~Well, I've managed to translate the last couple of pages for you. I... I really think you should read this.~
@1518 = ~Let me take a look at that for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1519 = ~(She quickly pages through the recent entries, scribbling some notes on the side)~
@1520 = ~Hmm...~
@1521 = ~Here, I've translated the last couple of pages for you. This looks fairly serious.~
@1522 = ~Th' pansy elfling deserved what he got, scrowny an' frail as he was.~
@1523 = ~Such is life. The weak are rooted out to make place for the strong who shall thrive.~
@1524 = ~N-No! I must help him somehow!~
@1525 = ~(Aerie holds up her holy symbol and chants)~
@1526 = ~Oh, Baervan, please lend me your strength!~
@1527 = ~(After a moment healing energies start flowing through Arledrian's body)~
@1528 = ~I... it worked! I think I've managed to stop his bleeding.~
@1529 = ~Try to hold on a bit longer! I will attempt to heal you.~
@1530 = ~(Jaheira holds up her mistletoe and chants)~
@1531 = ~Nature, show your mercy to this man.~
@1532 = ~And so, even in the darkest places nature provides us with her life-sustaining light. You are healed, Arledrian.~
@1533 = ~Do not give up hope that easily, elf.~
@1534 = ~(Anomen holds up his holy symbol and chants)~
@1535 = ~Helm, grant me the power...~
@1536 = ~It is done. In Helm's name, rise and be healed!~
@1537 = ~You can not be serious <CHARNAME>! Do you truly intend to kill this man in such a despicable manner?~
@1538 = ~Don't do this <CHARNAME>, you could regret it one day.~
@1539 = ~W-What are you Doing <CHARNAME>? You wouldn't just kill him like that... would you?~
@1540 = ~What a delicious idea <CHARNAME>! I'm impressed.~
@1541 = ~Har! This oughta' be fun to watch.~
@1542 = ~Har! This oughta' be fun to watch.~
@1543 = ~Ahh, Thieves' Cant - the art of innuendo! Although the accent is somewhat off by Athkatlan standards, I believe that she understood the meaning behind your words, <GABBER>.~
@1544 = ~Eh, what kind of crazy talk is that? <GABBER> sounds like a mad gibberling with all those twisted words! See how Boo scratches his little head in confusion?~
@1545 = ~Ach, ye're making me head spin with that doublespeak jabber of yers, <GABBER>. Just get it over wit' already an' see if the girl be havin' some decent weapons fer us!~
@1546 = ~Hmm, I've picked up bit and pieces of Thieves' Cant while slumming, but you seem to be exceptionally proficient at it, <GABBER>.~
@1547 = ~Well now, that was a mighty fine display of doublespeak, <GABBER>, but you have to be careful with your tongue. My cousin Sammy once twisted his so hard that it got all sore and the poor fellow couldn't eat anything but turnip mash for weeks!~
@1548 = ~Astounding, <GABBER>, you seem to have captured the very essence of chaos in your words! I am almost tempted to write down that riveting conversation of yours.~



// Chosen of Cyric main dialogue (2000-2999)

@2000 = ~(Upon closer inspection, this tiny cowled figure turns out to be a middle-aged halfling with a slight stubble on his chin and dark circles beneath his eyes.)~
@2001 = ~(He is tightly griping a short bow and impatiently shuffling through his arrow case. Every few seconds he looks towards Venduris as if waiting for a sign.)~
@2002 = ~(The shaft of his bow resembles two snakes, each trying to swallow an eyeball carved at the grip. You also manage to catch a faint glint coming from his quiver. Apparently, it holds three different types of arrows, two of which seem to be dipped in different hues of a greenish liquid while the third one is clearly pulsating with magic.)~
@2003 = ~(You feel pinpricks over the entire surface of your hands... a strong aura of evil surrounds this man.)~
@2004 = ~(He seems to thoroughly enjoy committing evil acts, and is directly responsible for many innocent deaths.)~

@2020 = ~(You see a huge leather-skinned man with a hint of green color to his face. His teeth seem sharper than normal and his face looks menacing.)~
@2021 = ~(He is holding a radiant blue axe in his right hand and a faintly glittering longsword in his left. Peering beneath a great horned helm, his sharp charcoal-gray eyes betray a cunning mind hiding behind this rough facade.)~
@2022 = ~(You see a huge leather-skinned man with a hint of green color to his face. His teeth seem sharper than normal and his face looks menacing. A sleek golden girdle sparkles around his burly waist and many large potion bottles are strapped onto it.)~
@2023 = ~(He is holding a radiant blue axe in his right hand and a faintly glittering longsword in his left. Whenever thunder rips across the sky the axe reacts with a crackle of energy. Peering beneath a great horned helm, his sharp charcoal-gray eyes betray a cunning mind hiding behind this rough facade.)~
@2024 = ~(You feel an intense, almost painful, pounding behind your eyes... a strong aura of evil surrounds this man.)~
@2025 = ~(He seems to truly relish in committing evil acts and is to be blamed for the deaths of countless innocents across the realms.)~

@2040 = ~(You see an older man with long, silvery-black hair and weathered yellow skin. Beneath the sleaves of his worn robe several silver bracelets are faintly glinting.)~
@2041 = ~(In his right hand he is clutching a mace and a divine symbol, while his left hand is holding a large, plainly adorned shield. His odd, crooked smile and the strange gleam in his eyes give him a half-crazed expression.)~
@2042 = ~(You see an older man with long, silvery-black hair and weathered yellow skin covered with many tattoos. Beneath the sleeves of his worn, purple robe several silver bracelets are faintly glinting.)~
@2043 = ~(Despite his venerable age he seems to bear the weight of the platemail armor which he hides beneath the robe with relative ease. In his right hand he is clutching a mace and a divine symbol, while his left hand is holding a plainly adorned shield. His odd, crooked smile and a strange gleam in his eyes give him a half-crazed expression.)~
@2044 = ~(You feel a sharp pain in your hands accompanied by an agonizing headache... an overwhelming aura of evil surrounds this man.)~
@2045 = ~(The man is undoubtedly evil to the core. From the nature and the intensity of his aura, you are quite certain that he is a priest of an evil god. He is fully corrupted, and willingly commits even the most despicable acts for the pleasure of his patron deity.)~

@2060 = ~(This dark-haired, pale-skinned young woman has a cultured and refined look about her. Her long, flowing hair stirs lightly in the heavy wind, but otherwise she doesn't appear to be bothered by the rain or the raging storm.)~
@2061 = ~(She is wearing a black robe and holding an oaken staff in her right hand. Her eyes are closed, and she seems to be concentrating.)~
@2062 = ~(She is wearing a black robe trimmed with silvery lines and holding a long oaken staff in her right hand. You notice that several magic scrolls and potions are tightly strapped to her belt. Her eyes are closed, and she seems to be concentrating.)~
@2063 = ~(Although you can barely see her face through the rain, its features look vaguely familiar to you for some reason. She reminds you of someone that you've met during your travels but you can't quite remember who it was.)~
@2064 = ~(Although you can barely see her face through the rain, its features look vaguely  familiar to you for some reason. Suddenly, you realize that this woman bears a striking resemblance to Marina, the half-elven merchant from the Shadow Thief guild. It is very likely that the two women are related.)~
@2065 = ~(Although you can barely see her face through the rain, her features look vaguely familiar to you for some reason. Suddenly, you realize that this woman bears a striking resemblance to Marina, the half-elven merchant from the Shadow Thief guild. It is very likely that the two women are related.)~
@2066 = ~(You feel a slight itch on the tips of your fingers...a faint aura of evil surrounds this woman.)~
@2067 = ~(She does not appear to be truly evil by nature, but rather, she seems to be committing evil acts because of an affection of some sort.)~
@2068 = ~(Upon hearing your words, the dark-haired young woman, who seemed to be meditating until now, slowly opens her eyes and gives you a cold, inquiring stare.)~
@2069 = ~(She glances towards Venduris for a second, but then quickly lowers her head and resumes her focus.)~

@2080 = ~(To Venduris' right stands a handsome young man of well-kept appearance.  He has a grim and determined expression on his face.)~
@2081 = ~(In his left hand he holds a long, forked dagger, while in his right hand rests a masterfully crafted short sword. From time to time, he tauntingly swipes the two blades against each other.)~
@2082 = ~(To Venduris' right stands a handsome young man of well-kept appearance. His shoulder-length black hair appears to be intentionally combed in a way which obscures the slightly pointy ears.)~
@2083 = ~(To untrained eyes, he would look like a normal human, but judging by your previous observation and the delicate facial features, you are quite certain that at least some elven blood flows through his veins.)~
@2084 = ~(In his left hand he holds a long, forked dagger with a red-hot tip, while in his right hand rests a masterfully crafted short sword etched with fine elvish runes. From time to time, he tauntingly swipes the two blades against each other.)~
@2085 = ~(The darkly colored mail which he wears seems more akin to cloth than a suit of armor. It folds with ease, fluently following his every move. Judging by its design, the chainmail appears to be of Underdark origin, but this man is clearly not a dark elf.)~
@2086 = ~(Noticing that you are watching him, he raises his head and stares back at you for a while. His eyes begin searching your face carefully, but suddenly, he twitches and turns away, as if he was unwilling to make eye contact with you. You realize that he just became aware of your elven descent.)~
@2087 = ~(For a moment, you saw a trace of hesitation in his eyes, but once his view shifted back to Venduris, his face quickly regained its previous grim and determined expression.)~
@2088 = ~(You feel a light throb behind your eyes... a faint aura of evil surrounds this man.)~
@2089 = ~(He does not appear to be truly evil by nature, but rather, the evil intentions seem to be somehow forced upon him.)~

@2100 = ~This magic scroll was found on the corpse of the rogue Venduris. The inscription on this side appears to be a note from the spellcaster who had created it. The other side of the paper is cowered with various arcane runes.~
@2101 = ~Read the note.~
@2102 = ~Examine the runes more closely.~
@2103 = ~Unfortunately, you lack the knowledge and skill to decipher the arcane writings on this scroll.~
@2104 = ~Rip the scroll apart in frustration.~
@2105 = ~"As you requested Venduris, the warding glyphs that will trap <CHARNAME> have been directly linked to the runes on this scroll. Since you insisted on being the only one who should know the Command Phrase for their activation I have left an empty line near the bottom of the opposite side where you can inscribe it."~
@2106 = ~"Be warned, once you do so, absolutely make sure that the scroll is kept safe and well hidden at all times. Because of this unusual casting method I can make no guarantee of what will happen to the wards should this scroll be damaged or destroyed." -S.~
@2107 = ~This side of the scroll bears many runes and symbols which clearly resemble the design of the wards that are blocking your path. You discern a pattern in the runes and realize that you could possibly use it to your advantage.~
@2108 = ~Examine the note.~
@2109 = ~\[Arcane Lore\] - Attempt to decipher the arcane writings on the scroll.~
@2110 = ~\[Read Language\] - Attempt to decipher the arcane writings on the scroll.~
@2111 = ~\[Read Magic\] - Attempt to decipher the arcane writings on the scroll.~
@2112 = ~Rip the scroll apart.~
@2113 = ~Apparently this scroll was an essential component of the warding process and the spell's energy seems to be directly linked to it. You successfully translate the arcane runes and manage to find the Command Phrase which affects the wards that are blocking your path.~
@2114 = ~You are quite certain that, once spoken, the phrase will safely nullify the wards, consuming the scroll in the process. Because of the link which they share, destroying the scroll could theoretically accomplish the same thing, though that would most likely cause an outburst of the stored energy.~
@2115 = ~Speak the Command Phrase~
@2116 = ~(With no other options left, you decide to rip the scroll apart.)~
@2117 = ~(You hold up the scroll and prepare to read the Command Phrase.)~

@2200 = ~As you probably know, I have already faced a band of your followers a while ago and yet I still live. This is a waste of time.~
@2201 = ~So be it!~
@2202 = ~Ahh, yes now that you mention it, I do seem to remember your encounter with my, oh so loyal, servant Venduris and his little band of zealots.~
@2203 = ~As I recall, you actually managed to defeat them in battle. How... peculiar.~
@2204 = ~As I recall, you actually managed to intimidate Venduris into leaving you alone. How... peculiar.~
@2205 = ~As I recall, you actually managed to intimidate Venduris enough to make him flee by merely assuming the form of the Slayer. How... peculiar.~
@2206 = ~As I recall, you actually assumed the form of the Slayer and annihilated Venduris along with the rest of his companions. How... peculiar.~
@2207 = ~As I recall, you actually managed to persuade Venduris that it would benefit him to let you live. How... peculiar.~
@2208 = ~As I recall, you actually managed to reason with Venduris and convince him into reconsidering his actions. How... peculiar.~
@2209 = ~In any case, it was indeed for the best that Venduris' little ordeal ended that way. Although my simple minions may have thought that they were acting in my best interests, who knows what kind of trouble their interference might have stirred up, had they been successful.~
@2210 = ~So what happens now?~
@2211 = ~Then can we end this?~
@2212 = ~Well then, in the light of these new circumstances, I have decided that you've already suffered enough meddling on my behalf... for now.~
@2213 = ~You are free to go then, <CHARNAME>. We are finished here.~
@2214 = ~Oh and, do try to enjoy your mortal life... while it lasts.~

@2500 = ~(You see before you a party of six companions evidently aligned in a combat formation and prepared for battle.)~
@2501 = ~(It strikes you as peculiar that most of their clothes are tinted black and dark purple, occasionally trimmed with silver lines, while their armor is adorned with the symbol of a white, jawless skull drawn over a black sunburst.)~
@2502 = ~(The man standing up front appears to be their leader. His entire body is enveloped within a large, black cloak which overshadows most of his features. Only the palms of his hands and the lower portion of his face remain visible to you.)~
@2503 = ~(Although his eyes are hidden from your view, you sense that he is peering at you intently from under his long hood. The unobscured part of his face looks cold and collected, failing to give away any notable emotion.)~
@2504 = ~(After a moment of silence, he steps forward and addresses you in a low, firm tone.)~
@2505 = ~Greetings... <CHARNAME>.~
@2506 = ~(The rogue notices the half-surprised expression forming on your face after you heard him utter your name so casually.)~
@2507 = ~Before you start wondering how I discerned your identity, I should tell you that I am, in fact, quite familiar with both your history and your lineage.~
@2508 = ~Though, I remain somewhat intrigued... do *you* have any idea who now stands before you, Bhaalspawn?~
@2509 = ~\[Religious Knowledge\] - I recognize the markings on your armor, rogue. The White Skull and the Dark Sun are both symbols of the Prince of Lies. You are followers of Cyric.~
@2510 = ~(Due to your severe lack of charisma you only manage to stare at the rogue and snarl angrily, being unable to create a coherent sentence and address him.)~
@2511 = ~\[Lore\] - Hmm, those markings on your armor look familiar. As I recall, the White Skull and the Dark Sun are both symbols of the Prince of Lies, so you must be followers of Cyric.~
@2512 = ~\[Insight\] - Judging by your distinctive appearance and my previous encounters with your ilk, I would say that you are servants of Cyric.~
@2513 = ~No... should I?~
@2514 = ~I don't know nor do I care. Now step aside, rogue, or I'll slaughter you like anyone else who gets in my way!  \[Prepare to attack him\]~
@2515 = ~(Due to your severe lack of charisma you only manage to stare at the rogue and snarl angrily, being unable to utter a coherent sentence and address him.)~
@2516 = ~(Due to your severe lack of intelligence you are straining heavily in an attempt to make a comprehensive sentence.)
- Uhmm... cloak-man wants talk with <CHARNAME>?~
@2517 = ~(Due to your severe lack of wisdom you do not have enough reasoning to do anything other than scratch your head and drool uncontrollably.)~
@2518 = ~(The rogue is sneering contemptuously at you)  Astounding... how a person of such low influence and social skills could have possibly come this far is still a riddle to me. Evidently, you lack the manners to even address me properly.~
@2519 = ~So be it then, I shall do the realms a favor and relieve you of your misery. Prepare to die simpleton!  \[He Attacks\]~
@2520 = ~(The rogue sneers disdainfully at your reply)  You are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of action <CHARNAME>, just as I had expected, but do not think that I can be taken lightly.~
@2521 = ~So be it then, let our blades speak for us now!  \[He Attacks\]~
@2522 = ~(The rogue sneers contemptuously at you)  So, you lack the common sense to even take notice of me? Then let us see if you will acknowledge my blade!~
@2523 = ~I shall do the realms a favor and relieve you of your misery. Prepare to die half-wit!  \[He Attacks\]~
@2524 = ~Hmm, so you are indeed clueless... I should have expected that much.   (A faint half-sneer forms on his face)   Let me enlighten you then, by whose orders you die today.~
@2525 = ~The will of the Prince of Lies guides our path, but rest assured Bhaalspawn, we are no mere followers of Cyric.~
@2526 = ~(The rogue's voice drops to a more menacing tone) Know, that we belong to the Order of his Chosen.~
@2527 = ~What exactly do you want from me ?~
@2528 = ~Get to the point rogue.~
@2529 = ~You poor, deluded fool...  (he looks at you contemptuously)  then you will know only this!~
@2530 = ~I am an assassin and *you* are my mark. One of us shall not outlive this day!  \[He attacks\]~
@2531 = ~Hmm, so the reports were true, you do indeed have some wit about you.  (A faint half-sneer forms on his face)~
@2532 = ~Though the will of the Prince of Lies truly guides our path, rest assured, Bhaalspawn, we are no mere followers of Cyric.~
@2533 = ~(The rogue's voice drops to a more menacing tone)   Know, that we belong to the Order of his Chosen.~
@2534 = ~\[Religious Knowledge\] - You belong to Cyric's Chosen? Then I suppose your fanatical order has somehow found out about my divine heritage, and you still hope to bring Cyric closer to his ascension by ritually sacrificing all of Bhaal's children. Am I right?~
@2535 = ~(The man slowly raises his head and his eyes flickers over you. His gaze falls on you with the force of a sledgehammer.)~
@2536 = ~Know, that there is a growing conflict of interests between us, Bhaalspawn.~
@2537 = ~By observing and carefully studying your actions over a lengthy time period, we have come to the only possible conclusion.~
@2538 = ~It is now more than evident to us that you are developing into a significant threat for our Lord and Master.~
@2539 = ~(With a faint swishing sound the rogue's cloak splits, and an ominous-looking blade springs into his hand.)~
@2540 = ~I, am Venduris, and as the highest-ranking assassin within our order, it is my sacred duty to make sure that this does not occur... by any means necessary!   \[He prepares to attack\]~
@2541 = ~\[Persuade\] - Hold your weapons Venduris, I would like to ask some questions first. Perhaps a battle between us is unnecessary.~
@2542 = ~\[Insight\] - Would you care to elaborate your point a bit further, rogue? I would prefer to know more of your motives.~
@2543 = ~\[Thieves' Cant\] - Come now Venduris, will there be no honor among thieves? Let us parley about this and lay our blades to rest for a while.~
@2544 = ~\[Flirt\] - Easy there, tall, dark and handsome... you wouldn't hurt a beautiful lady now would you?  (you display your most innocent smile and wink at Venduris seductively)~
@2545 = ~\[Beg\] - Wait! Spare me, please, I-I don't want to die yet!~
@2546 = ~Hah, an ambush! You will not get the best of me today rogue!  \[Attack him\]~
@2547 = ~(Venduris' expression remains unchanged, he seems to be completely unfazed by the whole display.)~
@2548 = ~(He says nothing, but his sword is still drawn and pointing straight at your throat. You are certain that he intends to attack you in a matter of seconds.)~
@2549 = ~\[Insight\] - Would you care to elaborate your point a bit further, rogue? I would prefer to know more of your motives.~
@2550 = ~(The rogue sneers disdainfully at your reply)~
@2551 = ~No, you offer no credible reason to delay this any further. It is time for me to end your existence, Bhaalspawn!  \[He Attacks\]~
@2552 = ~(As you swing your weapon towards Venduris he skillfully evades the blow, springing back smoothly.)~
@2553 = ~(As he catches his balance again he looks upon you with a wicked smile on his face.)~
@2554 = ~You are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of action <CHARNAME>, just as I had expected, but do not think that I can be taken so lightly.~
@2555 = ~So be it then, let our blades speak for us now!~
@2556 = ~(Venduris pauses, considering your words for a moment)~
@2557 = ~Very well, I can indulge that request <CHARNAME>, though you better not strain my patience too far. (He tightens the grip on his sword menacingly)~
@2558 = ~You may speak to me, but do so quickly and choose your words wisely.~
@2559 = ~(stall Venduris for a moment in order to examine the tactical options of this situation)~
@2560 = ~\[Arcane Lore\] - Those Warding Glyphs which prevent me from leaving, are they your work, Venduris?~
@2561 = ~Are those magics surrounding this area your work rogue?~
@2562 = ~I am curious... how come you know so much about me ?~
@2563 = ~You said that I was becoming a problem for Cyric. Could you elaborate on this further?~
@2564 = ~I have changed my mind, I think I want to fight you after all!  \[Attack him\].~
@2565 = ~\[Insight\] - So Venduris, you are evidently aware of my divine descent, but you do not seem to realize that direct, as well as indirect, intervention of the gods into the affairs of the Bhaalspawn was prohibited by Lord Ao himself. Therefore, any actions taken against me in the name of Cyric would mean that both you and your patron deity are purposely defying the will of the Overfather. For all you know, Cyric himself could be displeased by your interference.~
@2566 = ~\[Persuade\] - Since you were observing my actions so closely, Venduris, you should know by now that I have always stood on the side of Good. I have no reason or desire to succumb to the evil taint of my blood, I only wish to retrieve my stolen soul.~
@2567 = ~\[Persuade\] -  If you have been studying me as closely as you claim, then by now you should be aware that I, as a Paladin, have always stood as a power of light and righteousness. I have no reason or desire to succumb to the evil taint of my blood, I only wish to retrieve my stolen soul.~
@2568 = ~\[Intimidate\] - Enough of this charade, Venduris! I faced Irenicus himself at Spellhold and forced him into a retreat. I escaped the gloom of the Underdark unscathed, and I have just eradicated the most powerful vampire in Amn, together with a host of her strongest minions. Do you really think that you and your feeble-minded band of zealots can stop me?~
@2569 = ~It has always been common practice of our order to observe an enemy over a lengthy time period before acting, <CHARNAME>. We firmly believe that information is the key to true power.~
@2570 = ~We know how you act, how you fight and how you judge. We are aware of your every detail, no matter how insignificant it may seem.~
@2571 = ~Your alignment, your goals, your strengths and your weaknesses are all known to us, while you remain completely oblivious to our own plans.~
@2572 = ~As you can see, we are at a clear advantage here.~
@2573 = ~\[Insight\] - Hmm, if you and your order have been spying on me for so long, then how come I've never noticed any of you?~
@2574 = ~So when did you first start following me?~
@2575 = ~But why do you attack me now, and not before? Surely you had plenty of opportunities to do so in the past.~
@2576 = ~I see, let me ask you something else then.~
@2577 = ~Do you take my party for some amateurish band of pickpockets?  (Venduris pierces you with a reproachful gaze)~
@2578 = ~In truth, the people you are facing now rank among the most capable members of our order.~
@2579 = ~Furthermore, a number of our agents, placed within most major cities of the Sword Coast, are constantly obtaining vital information and insight about all who would oppose us, including yourself. They are highly adept at the art of subterfuge and have many ways of acting unseen.~
@2580 = ~So you see, it is truly no wonder that you, as most of our other victims, have never discovered our presence, let alone our plans.~
@2581 = ~Our order first took notice of you some time after you had slain two of our valuable members who were operating near the city of Baldur's Gate.~
@2582 = ~The two priests of Cyric that you killed back then, Mulahey and Bassilus, were our agents, and their murders served as a triggering point for our current actions against you.~
@2583 = ~We followed your activities until the final standoff with your half-brother Sarevok, who was also being carefully monitored at that time.~
@2584 = ~The Order wisely decided to let you slaughter each other so that we could easily take care of the weakened survivor.~
@2585 = ~But then why do you attack me now, and not before? You surely had plenty of opportunities to do so in the past.~
@2586 = ~Unlike Sarevok's, your own motives were still unclear to us at the time you left Baldur's Gate. So we decided to lay low, gather the necessary information and wait until a suitable chance for action abounded.~
@2587 = ~But when that half-crazed sorcerer interfered, we almost lost track of you. Luckily, a few of our informants within this city noticed when you embarked on a voyage to the Spellhold asylum.~
@2588 = ~After that, it was only a matter of time until we caught up with your trail.~
@2589 = ~Hmm, so when did you first start following me?~
@2590 = ~That should be quite obvious.  (He gives you a long, contemplating look)~
@2591 = ~Perhaps you still fail to realize this, but you <CHARNAME>, are the most powerful Bhaalspawn that has ever walked the Sword Coast. By this mere fact, you present a significant threat to our Lord's position.~
@2592 = ~You carry a touch of the divine inside you, and chances are that you will desire more in the future. Our Lord may be prevented from interfering directly in this matter, but as long as we are here of our own free will, nothing can deny us the pleasure of killing you.~
@2593 = ~\[Insight\] - Wait, you mean that you are acting here *without* direct orders from Cyric? You are doing this on your own?~
@2594 = ~(Venduris' eyes narrow for a moment and he gives you a resentful glare, but his face soon resumes its usual, emotionless expression)~
@2595 = ~We are indeed acting of our own accord, but that is of no consequence.~
@2596 = ~Once we dispose of you, our Lord will certainly acknowledge the deed and reward us accordingly.~
@2597 = ~(you make a mental note of what was just said)   Hmm... let me ask you something else then.~
@2598 = ~(Venduris pauses for a moment and then starts gazing at you suspiciously)~
@2599 = ~Hmm, that is indeed a possibility, <CHARNAME>, though merely one of many.~
@2600 = ~With equal right, I could clam that disposing of you was the Overfather's plan all along, and that we were actually predestined to be carry out his will.~
@2601 = ~Either way, while I can not be fully certain in this matter, I would prefer to eliminate you. Unhindered, you could possibly rise even further and try to take the place of our Lord. This can not be allowed to happen.~
@2602 = ~\[Lore\] - Then hear me out, Venduris. As soon as I found out about my true descent, I began actively studying the prophecies concerning Bhaalspawn. Nonetheless, in all this time, I've found nothing that openly suggests that one of us *must* doubtlessly rise up and take our father's place. If anything, my research indicates that the future of the Bhaalspawn is not set in stone and that each of us is free to shape his own destiny.~
@2603 = ~\[Insight\] - Then think about it this way, you say that you want to murder me in order to please Cyric, but are you aware that after my death, the part of Bhaal's essence which lies inside me will return to its source? In consequence, killing me would actually quicken my father's restoration.~
@2604 = ~\[Reason\] - Yet you can not be sure, for you said yourself that you are acting without the approval of Cyric. Perhaps it would be wiser to reconsider your course, Venduris... while you still can.~
@2605 = ~(Venduris ponders over your words for an instant, but his face remains an undecipherable riddle to you)~
@2606 = ~What you say... holds some merit, <CHARNAME>, but I can not be certain of the truth from merely hearing those words from your mouth.~
@2607 = ~\[Insight\] - Nonetheless, you can no longer risk killing me, until you have confirmed this information. The risk of accidentally contributing to Bhaal's resurrection by freeing the essence held inside me would be too high to take, even for someone in your position.~
@2608 = ~(Venduris looks like he is about to reply but instead, he pauses again, reflecting.)~
@2609 = ~(After a moment of thought, he looks up to you again, but his gaze is different now. The malice has disappeared from his eyes, and you even think that you can trace a bit of respect in his new demeanor.)~
@2610 = ~You... speak convincing words <CHARNAME>, and I can no longer dispute your arguments.~
@2611 = ~Then, there is only one solution left.  (Venduris reaches for the ring on his left hand)~
@2612 = ~We must depart for now and observe how the events unfold from afar... as we always have. When another opportunity presents itself, and once we are fully aware of all the consequences, we can always strike anew if need be.~
@2613 = ~Pray that we never meet again, Bhaalspawn. Your wits may not save you once more, as they have this day!  (He finishes the sentence with a wicked smile)~
@2614 = ~I admit, your knowledge on the subject is quite impressive. But then again, why should I believe anything you say? You could just as easily be lying to save your life.~
@2615 = ~\[Lore\] - Then consider this. If the prophecies of ascension are truly referring to me, and you are indeed supposed to kill me today, don't you think *that* would have also been foreseen? Yet, there is no mention of such an event in any of the texts. On the other hand, the warning to those who would interfere in the destiny of the Bhaalspawn is quite clear. As you well know, even Cyric himself could not risk to defy the will of the Overfather. So tell me, Venduris, do you really think that you can take such a chance?~
@2616 = ~I see, let me ask you something else.~
@2617 = ~Indeed, what you say is true, but in my line of work, I have often seen a good <PRO_MANWOMAN> fall in the reach of great power and unscrupulously betray <PRO_HISHER> former life and beliefs. You would not be the first nor the last one to make that choice.~
@2618 = ~\[Persuade\] -  All my life I have lived and served by the principles and beliefs of my faith and ethos. I fought only when it was necessary to protect my friends or when my own life was threatened. I have never killed a person for treasure or personal gain. Now answer me, Venduris, how can such a <PRO_MANWOMAN> possibly aspire to become the next <PRO_LADYLORD> of Murder?~
@2619 = ~\[Reputation\] - My deeds speak for me, Venduris. If you are so familiar with my life then you are surely aware of my accomplishments. I have never betrayed trust, and have always strived to help the ones in need. Think about it, are those the traits of a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who desires the power of Cyric and Bhaal?~
@2620 = ~(After a moment of thought, he looks up to you again, but his gaze is different now. The malice has disappeared from his eyes, and you even think that you can trace a bit of respect in his new demeanor.)~
@2621 = ~You... are right <CHARNAME>. The arguments you displayed are solid, I should have not doubted your path.~
@2622 = ~In fact, now that I am certain that you have no plans to usurp my Lord's rulership, I am willing to let you live.~
@2623 = ~Do not mistake this for charity though, I assure you, it is purely an act of self interest.~
@2624 = ~What do you mean?~
@2625 = ~I thought as much, but what exactly are you implying?~
@2626 = ~You will soon find out on your own, <CHARNAME>. For now, I shall say only this much, you were by far not the only contender for your father's throne. And now that I have assured myself of your allegiance, I can shift my efforts toward others of your kind.~
@2627 = ~Most of them are not as good-natured as you appear to be, and therefore require my immediate attention. However, if I let you live, you will probably dispose of a few of your brethren and save me some effort.   (Venduris finishes the sentence with a wicked smile)~
@2628 = ~But enough... we shall depart for now and leave you to your destiny. Farewell, <CHARNAME>. Hope that we never meet again! (He reaches for the ring on his left hand)~
@2629 = ~\[Persuade\] -  All my life I have lived by the same principles and beliefs - the ones of the Greater Good. I fought only when it was necessary to protect my friends or when my own life was threatened. I have never killed a person for treasure or personal gain. Now answer me, Venduris, how can such a <PRO_MANWOMAN> possibly aspire to become the next <PRO_LADYLORD> of Murder?~
@2630 = ~I agree, those are most impressive accomplishments, <CHARNAME>. However, we are much more resourceful than one would think, and your actions have been observed long enough for us to discover several ways of dealing with you swiftly and effectively.~
@2631 = ~Ignorant fool! I hold the power of a GOD at my disposal. You WILL learn to fear me!  \[Transform into the Slayer\]~
@2632 = ~\[Truth\] - Venduris, if you have studied me as closely as you claim, then you must be aware of the power that I wield. Even without my divine heritage I still rank among the most powerful mortals that have ever roamed the Realms. The same can be said for my fellow party members as well. Now tell me, do you truly want to risk your own life and the lives of your comrades by fighting us ?~
@2633 = ~\[Bluff\] - No matter what you may think Venduris, you are not aware of the full potential of my abilities! Even without my divine heritage I would still rank among the most powerful mortals that have ever roamed the Realms. The same can be said for my fellow party members as well. Now tell me, do you truly want to risk your own life and the lives of your comrades by fighting us ?~
@2634 = ~\[Bluff\] - No matter what you may think Venduris, you are not aware of the full potential of my abilities! Even without my divine heritage I would still rank among the most powerful mortals that have ever roamed the Realms. Now tell me, do you truly want to risk your own life and the lives of your comrades by fighting me?~
@2635 = ~\[Lie\] - No matter what you may think Venduris, you are not aware of the full potential of my abilities! Even without my divine heritage I would still rank among the most powerful mortals that have ever roamed the Realms. Now tell me, do you truly want to risk your own life and the lives of your comrades by fighting me?~
@2636 = ~\[Truth\] - Venduris, if you have studied me as closely as you claim, then you must be aware of the power that I wield. Even without my divine heritage I would still rank among the most powerful mortals that have ever roamed the Realms. Now tell me, do you truly want to risk your own life and the lives of your comrades by fighting me ?~
@2637 = ~\[Persuade\] - My words were hasty and ill-considered. Let us talk about something else then.~
@2638 = ~Ha! Let us do battle then, and find out who is truly superior here!  \[Attack Him\]~
@2639 = ~I guess you are right. Let us talk about something else then.~
@2640 = ~(Venduris gazes at you intently for a moment)~
@2641 = ~Indeed... your competence and skills have increased significantly since your departure from Baldur's Gate. They are much greater now than even my last reports from Athkatla had indicated.~
@2642 = ~Hmm, that little escapade at Spellhold seems to have actually strengthened you. I must reconsider my approach.~
@2643 = ~(He glances at you malevolently while reaching for the ring on his left hand)~
@2644 = ~We are departing... for now, but rest assured <CHARNAME>, this will not be the last time we meet!~
@2645 = ~I am not impressed by your empty boasts, <CHARNAME>. As I have already said, you have been studied with great detail and care. I am positive that our skill and competence can easily match your own.~
@2646 = ~Ha! Let us do battle then, and find out who is truly superior here!  \[Attack him\]~
@2647 = ~You poor, deluded fool...  (he sneers at you contemptuously)  Those empty boasts mean nothing to me. I am perfectly aware of my own abilities, as well as the skills of my companions.~
@2648 = ~Our combined might will be more than enough to crush you!  \[He prepares to attack\]~
@2649 = ~You are the only fool here, Venduris! I hold the power of a GOD at my disposal. You WILL learn to fear me!  \[Transform into the Slayer\]~
@2650 = ~Damn, he saw right through it!  \[Prepare for battle\]~
@2651 = ~Though your abilities may truly be greater than mine, I shall not give up so easily.~
@2652 = ~(He confidently looks straight into your eyes)~
@2653 = ~You do realize <CHARNAME>, that you are but a single <PRO_MANWOMAN> against the six of us. Even with all the power that you wield, we are still at an advantage here. You alone stand no chance against the combined might of the Chosen of Cyric.~
@2654 = ~Even though your abilities may truly be greater than my own, I shall not give up so easily.~
@2655 = ~You do realize <CHARNAME>, that you are facing superior numbers here. Even with all the power that you wield, the six of us are still at an advantage here. Your petty lot stands no chance against the combined might of the Chosen of Cyric.~
@2656 = ~(You manage to successfully distract Venduris and take a moment to examine your surroundings.)~
@2657 = ~\[Focus your eyesight\] - try to get a better view of your opponents despite the darkness and the storm.~
@2658 = ~\[Infravision\] - use your keen eyesight to get a better view of your opponents.~
@2659 = ~\[Infravision\] - use your enhanced perception to get a better view of your opponents.~
@2660 = ~\[Detect Evil Intent\] - focus yourself and attempt to determine the measure of evil within your opponents.~
@2661 = ~\[Find Traps\] - scan the area for traps, as discreetly as possible.~
@2662 = ~\[Detect Slope\] - try to discover any irregularities of the surrounding terrain, using your refined <PRO_RACE> senses.~
@2663 = ~\[Tracking\] - examine the markings on the ground, as discreetly as possible.~
@2664 = ~\[Arcane Lore\] - Examine the shimmering runes inscribed on the ground.~
@2665 = ~(Resume the normal conversation)~
@2666 = ~(As Venduris has stepped closer, you are now able to see the remainder of his face. The rogue's expression is still calm and collected, failing to give away any notable emotion, but you now notice that his pale, green eyes look cold and cruel.)~
@2667 = ~(No matter how hard you try, you cannot see the rest of Venduris' features and equipment, as they are completely obscured by his long, black cloak. Furthermore, the few visible parts of his armor seem to meld into the surrounding darkness, making him look like an ominous shadow.)~
@2668 = ~(The only clearly visible detail on him is his short sword, which is pulsating in a radiant green glow. The tip is pointing directly towards your throat.)~
@2669 = ~(Despite your infravision, no matter how hard you try you cannot see the rest of Venduris' features and equipment as they are completely obscured by his long black cloak. Furthermore, the few visible parts of his leather armor seem to meld into the surrounding darkness, making him look like an ominous shadow.)~
@2670 = ~(The only clearly visible detail on Venduris is his sword, which seems to be pulsating with a radiant, green glow. The tip is pointing directly towards your throat.)~
@2671 = ~(No matter how hard you concentrate, you can not detect any evil emanations from Venduris. You feel absolutely nothing in his presence.)~
@2672 = ~(You are uncertain whether he actually holds no evil intents or if some unknown force purposely blocks your senses.)~
@2673 = ~(You notice several freshly dug holes near the gates. They are fairly shallow and almost perfectly covered up by the muddy ground.)~
@2674 = ~(Judging by the dig marks, you suspect that a bulky mechanical device has been recently buried there, most likely a proximity-triggered snare. It would be wise to keep a safe distance from the gateway.)~
@2675 = ~(You manage to notice several freshly dug holes near the gates. They are fairly shallow and almost perfectly covered up by the muddy ground.)~
@2676 = ~(Judging by the dig marks, you suspect that something bulky was recently buried there, possibly a snare of some sort. It would be wise to keep a safe distance from the gateway.)~
@2677 = ~(You throw a quick glance at the tracks in the mud, hoping that Venduris won't notice your intent. Although most footprints were wiped out by the rain, you manage to make a quick overview of the area.)~
@2678 = ~(The clearing below the archway shows traces of heavy activity, and many tracks lead toward as well as away from the gates. Long, furrow imprints on the ground indicate that several heavy and bulky objects were hastily dragged up to the gateway.)~
@2679 = ~(The soil in that area looks freshly dug up, something has recently been burrowed there.)~
@2680 = ~(The patterns on the ground appear to be some sort of warding glyphs, definitively arcane in nature. You presume that they were activated by the command words which Venduris spoke when you approached.)~
@2681 = ~(The wards appear to be hindering your passage by forming some kind of barrier around this area. It now seems to be fully cut off from the rest of the city.)~
@2682 = ~Indeed, a truly fitting trap for a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of your power. Don't even bother trying, you will quickly find yourself unable to do anything against their influence.  (You catch a spark of superiority in his eyes)~
@2683 = ~Hmm, I see that you are indeed familiar with the Arcane arts, just as my reports had described. No matter, the wards are a fitting trap, even for a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of your power.~
@2684 = ~Don't even bother trying, you will quickly find yourself unable to do anything against their influence.  (You catch a spark of superiority in his eyes)~
@2685 = ~What makes you so sure of that?~
@2686 = ~A simple, yet extremely effective precaution was taken to prevent anyone from interfering. The warding glyphs that surround this area cannot be undone without a unique command phrase known only by me.~
@2687 = ~Furthermore, your own blood, <CHARNAME>, has been used as a spell component so the wards are attuned to you personally. This conveniently prevents you from directly affecting the barrier in any way or leaving this area without my permission.~
@2688 = ~\[Arcane Lore\] - Ahh, but you didn't actually cast the original spell yourself, did you, Venduris? You are merely using a command phrase and that scroll of yours to control it. It is quite obvious from your clumsy somatic gestures that you lack any *real* arcane training.~
@2689 = ~\[Insight]\ - *Your* permission? You mean that you have cast this warding spell all by yourself? You don't really strike me as the mage type, Venduris.~
@2690 = ~And how did you manage to dispell my protections and enchantments so easily? Even the most skilled members of the Cowled Wizards would have had difficulties with that, considering the degree of my power.~
@2691 = ~My blood...? And just how did you get ahold of that?~
@2692 = ~Furthermore, your own blood, <CHARNAME>, as well as that of your fellow party members, was used as a spell component so the wards are attuned to you personally. This conveniently prevents you from directly affecting the barrier in any way or leaving this area without my permission.~
@2693 = ~Our blood...? And just how did you get ahold of that?~
@2694 = ~(Venduris lightly traces the edge of his blade)   I can assure you, that was easier than one would imagine.~
@2695 = ~You have fought countless battles, leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in your wake. But at the same time, you, Bhaalspawn, have suffered many wounds as well.~
@2696 = ~(A devious half-sneer briefly forms on his face)  Gathering the few precious drops, which my spellcasters required, from a blood-soaked battlefield was a trivial matter.~
@2697 = ~\[Arcane Lore\] - You said earlier that I need *your* permission to leave this place. Somehow, I don't think that you were the one who has cast the original spell, Venduris. In fact, I believe that you are merely using a command phrase and that scroll of yours to control it. It is quite obvious from your clumsy somatic gestures that you lack any *real* arcane training.~
@2698 = ~\[Insight]\ - You said earlier that I need *your* permission to leave this place. Do you mean that you have cast this warding spell all by yourself? Hmm, you don't really strike me as the mage type, Venduris.~
@2699 = ~(Venduris' eyes flicker fiercely and he scowls at you for a second, as if suddenly realizing that he has just said something that he shouldn't have, but he quickly manages to recompose himself.)~
@2700 = ~*That* is of no consequence. Suffice to say that I now have full control over the wards, and that it is not possible to get by them without my approval. You, <CHARNAME>, will remain trapped here as long as I require it.~
@2701 = ~(you make a mental note of what was just said)   Hmm... alright, but you said earlier that you used my blood for the incantation. Just how did you get ahold of that?~
@2702 = ~(you make a mental note of what was just said)   Hmm... alright, but you said earlier that you used our blood for the incantation. Just how did you get ahold of that?~
@2703 = ~(you make a mental note of what was just said)   Hmm... I see, let me ask you something else then.~
@2704 = ~The anti-magic wave was just a convenient side effect of invoking the main warding spell, though I didn't actually plan it that way. In truth, it was merely an unpredictable discharge of the magical energies which feed the wards.~
@2705 = ~Apparently, it affected only you since the main spell was so closely attuned to your blood.~
@2706 = ~Bah! Let me ask you something else then.~
@2707 = ~(Venduris slightly twists the ring, and he and his entire party suddenly disappear before your very eyes.)~
@2708 = ~(Venduris appears slightly surprised by your display of power but still manages to keep his cool.)~
@2709 = ~Hmm... I had been assured that your assuming of Bhaal's avatar form was sporadic and uncontrollable.~
@2710 = ~As this doesn't seem to be the case anymore, I shall have to reconsider my approach.  (Venduris reaches for the ring on his left hand)~
@2711 = ~We are departing... for now, but rest assured <CHARNAME>, this will not be the last time we meet!  (He twists the ring slightly)~
@2712 = ~\[Give in to your anger\] - Lunge forward and rip Venduris' head off before he can manage to escape.~
@2713 = ~\[Transform back\] - calm your fury and let Venduris escape.~
@2714 = ~(At the moment, Venduris is unaware of your murderous intent. He is merely attempting to flee. Should you decide to kill him now, it will be done in cold blood.)~


//  Chosen of Cyric partymember interjectons (3000-3999)

@3000 = ~Oh, come on, <CHARNAME>, they are Cyric's goons! Don't you recognize those huge jawless skulls sprawled all over their clothes? We've dealt with their kind many times before.~
@3001 = ~By Torm's blade! Judging by the symbols on their clothes these villains are surely followers of Cyric, and likely high-ranking ones at that. Be on your guard, <CHARNAME>!~
@3002 = ~These fanatics are most certainly worshipers of the Prince of Lies. Helm, grant us strength!~
@3003 = ~The Harpers have had plenty of dealings with their ilk, <CHARNAME>. There is little doubt that these rogues are servants of Cyric.~
@3004 = ~I've never seen this cloaked man before, but Boo can smell his evil from here, and Boo's nose is never wrong!~
@3005 = ~What are you doing, <CHARNAME>? This isn't like you at all! Don't give in... don't become like them. Resist little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, I beg you!~
@3006 = ~Restrain yourself, <CHARNAME>! Do not let the taint take your mind. Restrain your anger and let the urge pass, <PRO_GIRLBOY>!~
@3007 = ~Gorion would be ashamed if he could see you now <CHARNAME>. Do not forfeit everything he has taught you so easily! Recompose yourself and defy the taint!~
@3008 = ~N-No! <CHARNAME>, you must resist! If you let yourself go like that, you will never be the same person again. Please... don't give in!~
@3009 = ~The power of your divine heritage is manifesting itself, <CHARNAME>. Embrace it, and show them your true strength!~
@3010 = ~Ach, 'tis been a while since I've seen a proper bloodbath. Ye be sure to give 'em what they're askin' fer, <CHARNAME>!~
@3011 = ~Hmm, magical wards attuned to our very blood? A most impressive technique. (I better take some notes).~
@3012 = ~They really used our... blood? Eww, that's just gross! You'd never get me to cast such a spell, <CHARNAME>, not in a million years.~
@3013 = ~So that's when this all started then? Hmm, I admit that I've always wondered why we kept facing so many followers of Cyric during our travels. It seems that you've really piqued their interest <CHARNAME>.~
@3014 = ~They've been stalking us all this time, huh? Hmm, now that I think about it, that strange halfling does look kind of familiar. I think I've seen him sneaking around Gullykin before.~
@3015 = ~A-hah! I kept telling you simians that we were being followed but, of course, nobody paid attention. (They even called me paranoid. Such ignorant fools!)~
@3016 = ~Boo thinks these strange people smell funny, and he remembers that smell way back from Nashkel mines. Be wary <CHARNAME>, evil is afoot!~
@3017 = ~My raven, may I take one last look at that scroll before it makes acquaintance with entropy?~
@3018 = ~Ah, though the fair sorceress was as cunning as she was beautiful, I do believe that I've found a way to undo her work. A simple Command Phrase, but it should do the trick.~
@3019 = ~Observe my raven, I've marked a few lines which you need to read in order to restore our freedom. And try to make it sound dramatic, for should you fail, we are most assuredly doomed to spend an eternity inside this devious magical entrapment.~
@3020 = ~Just a minute there <CHARNAME>! You don't want to end up like my uncle Cinders after he fell into a wagon full of fireworks and accidentally blew it up with a single spark from his pipe. Well, at least it was his own birthday party that he ruined. Anyway, you better let me take a look at that thing.~
@3021 = ~Hmm.. I think I've solved it! By the looks of it, that poor lass had attuned the wards to a simple Command Phrase. Hardly ingenious, but I suppose it can be effective at times.~
@3022 = ~<CHARNAME>, I've marked here a few lines that you should read. And make it loud too, so that we can finally escape this dreadfull magical cage.~
@3023 = ~W-Wait, <CHARNAME>! Can I take a look at that first, please?~
@3024 = ~Oh! I-I believe I can understand this, and if I'm reading it right, the wards can be lowered with a simple Command Phrase! Do you... do you think it could actually be that easy?~
@3025 = ~Um, <CHARNAME>, I've marked the lines you need to read. Just say that out loud and we should be free again, I h-hope.~
@3026 = ~Hold on there, <CHARNAME>! Can I take a look at that scroll before you needlessly endanger the whole city with your recklessness?~
@3027 = ~Hmm... if I'm reading this correctly, the wards can be lowered with a special Command Phrase. Simple, but also very effective.~
@3028 = ~Here, <CHARNAME>, I've marked the lines you need to read. Now say that out loud so we can finally be free of this nightmare.~
@3029 = ~Wait! Little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, why don't you let *me* take a look at that thing before you trash it.~
@3030 = ~Just a moment. Hmm, now what was that Gorion always used to say about magical barriers? If I could only remember...~
@3031 = ~Oh, right! Ahem, as I recall: "They can often be broken with a proper Command Phrase." (she unsuccessfully attempts to imitate Gorion's stern, lecturing voice while pronouncing this)~
@3032 = ~Look here, <CHARNAME>, it's really simple. I've marked the lines which you need to read. Just make sure you're loud enough and we should be out of here in no time.~
@3033 = ~Wait, you incompetent oaf! Give *me* that thing before you blow us all up. (Such insolence! Ignoring my genius and needlessly endangering us all.)~
@3034 = ~Hmm, now let's see...~
@3035 = ~A-hah! This petty sorcery is no match for my genius - a simple Command Phrase! Bah, how pathetic.~
@3036 = ~Now, look closely, <CHARNAME>, I'll mark a few lines here, you just need to read them out loud. (Even *<PRO_HESHE>* should be able to accomplish that.)~
@3037 = ~There, now hurry it up so we can finally get going.~
@3038 = ~Yes, I have felt this rivvil's chilling stare on my back before. I always presumed that he was after me, though it appears that your heritage outweighs even my own infamy, <CHARNAME>.~



// RR Upgradeable items (5000-5999)

@5000 = ~Blazing Glory~
@5001 = ~For many generations, this shield was passed down to selected High Jurists of Amaunator who took upon them the duty of cleansing the lands of all undead. After Amaunator seemingly disappeared and the Keep of the Eternal Sun had fallen, the shield's brilliant golden finish began to fade and its powerful enchantments started to dissolve. Eventually, the once mighty artifact was degraded to a mere wall decoration. As time passed, Amaunator's followers slowly fell into disarray and started to disband. The shield was lastly pillaged from their temple along with many other relics.

Fused with Amaunator's holy symbol, the shield pulses with energy once again. Some of its former powers have been restored.

Upon closer examination, powerful druidic enchantments can be discovered on the shield's surface. It appears that they slightly increase the shieldbearer's health and make any sustained wounds heal faster. Every morning, at sunrise, one of the leaves glows faintly for a moment. It can then be picked and planted into the ground while another instantly grows back to take its place. After the proper incantation is spoken, the planted leaf quickly grows into a fearsome Shambling Mound whose strength and size seem to be directly linked to the power of the shieldbearer.

@5006 = ~Stormcharged Axe +5~
@5007 = ~This superbly crafted axe holds an enchantment of unusual origin. Immediately after it was forged the axe was brought on top of a high mountain peak where dwarven priests waited for a great storm to gather. The weapon was placed on an iron pedestal and soon afterward struck by a bolt of lightning. Because of the pre-placed enchantment it absorbed some of the bolt's properties. The axe was later given to a high-ranking dwarven officer to aid him in the ensuing battle between the orcish hordes and the dwarves of Dorn's Deep. The attack came as a complete surprise to the dwarves when one morning a scout arrived and told that the largest orcish army he had ever seen was only hours away. With little time to prepare, the dwarven warriors were overrun and the orcs began to pour into Dorn's Deep. The dwarves were forced to retreat into the depths of the citadel but key passages were collapsed to cover their movements and buy them time. Even in such dire conditions, this allowed the dwarves to control when and where they would fight. Every battle cost the orcs dearly as the dwarves fought on their terms, but they were still being driven farther and farther back into Wyrm's Tooth Glacier. Eventually, due to their superior numbers, the orcs managed to breach the dwarven defenses and plunder their homes.

Coated with the other worldly Starfall Ore and infused with the essence of a Lapis Lazuli, the powers of this already formidable weapon are greatly enhanced.

In the hands of any character this sword acts as a standard +5 magical weapon, but in the hands of a Thief it becomes especially potent by increasing his chances to score a critical hit and improving his backstab multiplier.

@5012 = ~Returning Frost Dart +3~
@5013 = ~It is rumored that a cunning priestess of Auril created dozens of these darts in order to provide her temple guards with a weapon of last resort. A dart seemed perfect for the task since it was very easy to conceal. Minor enchantments which cause frost burns and return the dart to the wielder's hand after striking were added as well. In general, such weapons are rarely seen outside of Auril's temples, which are commonly located on the snow-covered peeks of Icewind Dale. However, in the recent years, a few merchants from the Ten Towns region have been acquiring suspiciously large quantities of these darts from local adventuring parties.

The mithril coating appears to have enhanced the dart's magical capabilities a bit further.

When the orcish tribes started raiding their city the wizards created golems of terrible power to protect them. Sensing that the brute strength of his warriors was not enough, the great orc chieftain Gull-Nar ordered his shamans to craft a weapon that would allow him to smash the "living statues" into rubble. His shamans used the books from a raided wizard tower to enchant the favorite weapon of their chieftain, a great war club. Gull-Nar was so pleased that he decided to personally lead the next raid, smashing the golems into bits as he proceeded toward the city core. Victory was near, but then a lone mage dressed in black appeared out of nowhere and cast a powerful spell which caused the raging orcs to turn upon each other. In mere minutes, their numbers were decimated and Gull-Nar himself was killed by his most trusted warriors.

Further enchanted using knowledge obtained from the Golem Manual, the club becomes an even more potent weapon against the fearsome constructs.

@5019 = ~Keeper of the Law +3~
@5020 = ~This blade once belonged Lao-Tzu, a samurai from one of the southern provinces of Kara-Tur. Upon finishing his training the warrior had sworn an oath to finally free his lands from the bandits and brigands which had plagued his people for the last ten years. However, that task proved fairly difficult as his opponents were cunning, and only struck late at night, always wearing hoods and masks. Lao-Tzu understood that these bandits had no honor and that may well be hiding among the very people which he sought to protect, but he dared not act merely on impulse for his code of conduct would not permit him to falsely accuse an innocent. To aid him in this task, Lao-Tzu sought a great Wu Jen master and asked him to enchant his wakizashi with the ability to sense the true intentions of a person and to strike vigorously against those without honor. The samurai organized a feast for the people in order to lift the spirits of the robbed ones and to drive out the bandits into the open. The people answered his call and Lao-Tzu was pleased. Using the power of his new weapon he managed to separate the cunning bandits from the simple peasants and to seat them inside a separate dining hall. Once they were all rounded up, the samurai barred the only exit and fought alone against a dozen rogues. After a short battle Lao-Tzu emerged victorious, but his honor did not allow him to kill even such unworthy foes. Instead, the samurai exiled the bandits from the province and his people finally knew peace.

Infused with the properties of Illithid brine water, the sword has become even more effective against Chaotically aligned opponents. Furthermore, it can now protect the mind of its wielder against chaos-based magic for a small amount of time.

It was wielded by chieftain Aukthar of the Blackraven tribe in many clashes between his people and the orcish hordes which periodically attempted to invade Ravenrock, their ancestral mound. The weapon was lost during one particularly fierce battle when the war cries of the combatants triggered a huge avalanche which swept them down the mountainside.

Infused with the powdered essence of a Beljuril, this weapon has become even more effective at causing fatigue. Consequently, the wielder of the weapon is immune to artificially caused fatigue effects (i.e. fatigue caused by a Haste spell) but still suffers normal fatigue effects from the lack of resting.

It is likely that the Shadowlord himself blessed this item with his touch, granting it the power to hide and guard his followers from any dangers which they may encounter in their risky professions.

@6001 = ~That ol' battered buckler ye're holdin' was once a mighty relic that belonged to a high priest of Amaunator, if me eyes don't be deceiving me. In case ye somehow stumble upon a holy symbol of the lost sun god, I could infuse the shield with its essence and restore some of the relic's old power.~
@6002 = ~Ye have the old relic of Amaunator and the sun god's holy symbol. For 7,500 gold, I could try to fuse them together for ye.~

// Thief and Bard HLA revisions (8000-8999)

@8000 = ~Danger Sense~
@8001 = ~Danger Sense

By studying his surroundings intently, an experienced Thief can predict the actions of his opponents through cunning insight and extraordinary perception. Any potentially hostile actions are perceived in advance, giving the Thief enough time to react appropriately. This uncanny sense for impending danger almost borders on precognition and grants the Thief a +5 bonus to his armor class and all saving throws for 5 rounds after this ability is activated. Furthermore, as the Thief cannot be surprised nor caught off guard while using this ability, he is not susceptible to backstab attacks until the duration expires.~

@8002 = ~Evades effects~
@8003 = ~Evasion

Thieves of exceptional skill can avoid damage from energy discharges, such as breath weapons, fireball spells and the like through a combination of superior reflexes and extraordinary agility. Through nearly superhuman effort, a Thief can position himself out of harm's way mere seconds before an energy discharge reaches him. After activating this ability the Thief can evade the effects of the following spells: Burning Hands, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Call Lightning, Flame Strike, Cone of Cold, Sunfire, Chain Lightning, Delayed Blast Fireball and all forms of Dragon's Breath. The Evasion ability expires after five rounds.

Requires: Danger Sense~

@8004 = ~Crippling Strike~
@8005 = ~Crippling Strike

An experienced Thief can use the knowledge of his opponent's weak spots to gain an advantage in combat. During the round when this ability is activated, every attack of the Thief deals maximum damage and may weaken his target. On each successful hit the victim must make a saving throw vs. death (with a -4 penalty) or have its strength score lowered to 10 for the next five rounds. Note: Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures are completely unaffected by this ability.

Requires: Assassination~

@8006 = ~Resonating Weapon~
@8007 = ~Resonating Weapon

Bards eventually achieve a high degree of control over sound which enables them to imbue any weapon with concentrated sound energy for a short while. A weapon imbued in this fashion resonates with a sharp tone and deals an extra 2d4 points of sonic damage to its target on each hit. Furthermore, anyone struck by the resonating weapon must save vs. breath or become temporarily deafened. After 2 rounds have passed, the weapon ceases to resonate and the deafness subsides.~

@8008 = ~Sound Barrier~
@8009 = ~Sound Barrier

The most skilled of all Bards are able to fully control the intensity, speed, and direction of the very waves which compose sound, which allows them to shape and bend it as they see fit. By utilizing this ability, the Bard encases himself within a sphere of swirling sound waves, thereby forming a barrier which protects him from all sound-based spells and attacks (Silence, Deafness, Command/Greater Command, Power Word (any), Holy/Unholy Word, Wail of the Banshee and Demilich Howl). Anyone who attempts to break through the barrier and strike the Bard in melee takes 2d8 points of sonic damage. Furthermore, the attacker may become deafened (75% chance) or stunned (25% chance) during the following round unless a save vs. breath is made. The sound barrier dissipates after 5 rounds.

Requires: Resonating Weapon~

@8010 = ~Set Acid Trap~
@8011 = ~Set Acid Trap

This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful trap that splashes nearby opponents with a highly vitriolic alchemical mixture which deals 10d6 points of acid damage. Once the acid engulfs a target it becomes difficult to remove. Afflicted opponents must make a saving throw vs. breath or take an additional 2d6 points of acid damage during each of the following three rounds. Creatures who are particularly vulnerable to acid damage (such as Trolls) do not get a saving throw.~

@8012 = ~Insightful Strike~
@8013 = ~Insightful Strike

An experienced Swashbuckler can use the knowledge of his opponent's weak spots to gain an advantage in combat. During the round when this ability is activated, the Swashbuckler receives a +5 bonus to his critical hit rolls and deals maximum damage with each attack.~
@8014 = ~Avoid Death

With a superhuman effort, a high-level rogue can avoid almost certain death. The effect lasts for 5 rounds and during this time the rogue's save vs. death receives a bonus of 5, hit points are increased by 20 and the rogue becomes immune to death magic for the duration of the ability.

Requires: Danger Sense~
@8015 = ~Avoid Death

With a superhuman effort, a high-level rogue can avoid almost certain death. The effect lasts for 5 rounds and during this time the rogue's save vs. death receives a bonus of 5, hit points are increased by 20 and the rogue becomes immune to death magic for the duration of the ability.~

@8016 = ~Set Exploding Trap

By mixing unstable alchemical compounds together, a rogue can set a trap which unleashes a powerful explosion when triggered. The force of the blast causes 15d6 points of fire damage and may knock nearby opponents off their feet. Enemies may attempt to save vs. breath in order to reduce the damage by half and avoid being knocked down. Exceptionally large or heavy creatures (Dragons, Giants, Stone and Iron Golems) cannot be knocked down.~

@8017 = ~Set Spike Trap

This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful spring-loaded spike trap that deals 20D6 points of piercing damage to the unsuspecting creature that sets it off.~


// Revised Alchemy HLA and assorted dialogue (8100 - 8199)

// Revised Scribe Scrolls HLA and assorted dialogue (8200-8300)
// Note to translators: these strings are identical to those used in my aTweaks mod

@8200 = ~Scribe Scrolls
This ability allows an experienced spellcaster to scribe a spell from his spellbook onto a scroll. Only a spell that is currently memorized may be scribed in this manner. Furthermore, the cost of any raw materials that are used in the process must be covered in full. Finally, inscribing a scroll removes one instance of the spell in question from the caster's memory.
